I?ve delighted in Rahul and Raj and the romantic fantasies they engendered over the last two decades. I cry when Rahul becomes a widower in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and swoon when Raj sweeps Simran in his arms amidst the swaying mustard fields in Dilwale Dulhania So it breaks my heart to tell you that Chennai Express left me cold. This hyper, eager-to-please Rahul sorely tested my patience. And after a while, the innumerable references to DDLJ seemed like a lazy shot at siphoning some of the enduring affection we have for that film. The fundamental problem is a clash of sensibility. Shah Rukh embodies the urbane, effortlessly suave and charming metro man. Director Rohit Shetty specialises in amped-up, largely logic-less and incoherent storytelling with a generous dose of low-brow humour that, at its best, is laugh-out-loud funny ? do you remember that wonderful scene in Golmaal 3 in which Prem Chopra is humiliating his daughter?s poor suitor, played by Mithun Chakraborty? When Prem Chopra asks, ?Karte kya ho tum?? Mithun Chakraborty, wearing a purposefully awful wig replies, ?I am a disco dancer. Zindagi mera gana, main usi ka deewana.? It was priceless. But Chennai Express plays neither to Rohit?s strengths nor to Shah Rukh?s. It?s a strangely sloppy mishmash of cheesy humour, half-hearted romance, half-baked emotion and head-banging action. The film is filled with gigantic men whose size functions as a punch line. Yes, some of it is funny. The locations are beautiful. And I enjoyed watching Deepika Padukone as Meena, the don?s daughter with the thick accent, who meets Rahul on Chennai Express and turns his life upside down. Padukone?s spirited performance ? she even makes that accent attractive ? helps to lift the film. But, mostly, Chennai Express is a slog. Rohit?s movies have never been about plot or character or performances. His films have only one function: to entertain you by whatever means necessary. But sadly a film specifically designed not to bore does exactly that. Two weeks ago, I had interviewed Shah Rukh and asked him whether in choosing to do a determinedly loud, over-the-top film like Chennai Express, he was cheating on his core audience ? urban, educated, metro folk. Shah Rukh replied that he would never cheat on us but that people who have loved his earlier avatars will just have to accept that he?s going through a phase. We do. Now come back Rahul. All is forgiven.</Review>

Director Rohit Shetty has achieved an enormous deal by being one but it has also limited his creative progress. Unlike his films, he's a pretty sharp guy but there's a sameness to his shtick. Does Chennai Express break away from it? Not always. But even with his overstating approach, it's decidedly more zany compared to all the Golmaal sequels and ilk he's doled out in recent years. Shah Rukh Khan's Eid release co-starring Deepika Padukone felt like a film that's better experienced with an audience instead of analysts. So I skipped the press screening and bought a ticket for a paid preview scheduled to start around the same time. Conscious of the afore-mentioned monotony and cultural stereotypes characterising Bollywood's depiction of any community, I entered the hall with a modest objective -- 10 laughs. If Chennai Express can give me a minimum of these many chuckle-worthy occasions, I'm good. Does it? Read on. It all starts with a bleeding SRK about to be hammered by some threatening brutes when his own voiceover rather pleasantly transports us to the land of Bollywood's favourite narrative technique -- flashback. Khan plays (S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E) Rahul. And he's (uh, belated happy birthday?) 40 and works as a (Gee, this is unique. And irrelevant), halwai. What triggers this movie's title is the endearing actor/filmmaker Lekh Tandon, in a brief appearance as Rahul's almost centenarian grandfather and Sachin Tendulkar's greatest fan. After he passes away, Rahul is assigned the task of immersing part of his ashes in Rameswaram's waters. Our man takes the first opportunity to resurrect his previously dead social life and hops on Chennai Express with Goa on his mind. A train about to leave the platform can only mean one thing --Dilwale Dulhania *Sigh* Le Jayenge. Miraculously enough, my scowl soon disappears into a smile and amplifies into a giggle responding to the unexpected spoof that follows. Mission laughter activated. Never to waste time on nuances, Shetty immediately sets stage for a wacky camaraderie between Rahul and Meenamma (Padukone works an excessive accent that marries Mehmood, Mithun Chakraborty and Lola Kutty --Jahan se hum train kheenchte hai wahin se station shuru hoti hai) as they converse in a medley of Bollywood songs while her four burly captors look on part hostile, part amused. Meenamma has standard issues-- rigid 'don-nna' father (an effective Sathyaraj) wants her to marry a boy of his choice but the focus is on SRK's breathless babbling and panicky reaction to her chaperone's sickle-flashing ways. Her lies and his willingness to play along leads this couple on a 142 minutes long adventure against the lush heartland of South India. Shetty seems to have deliberately kept the action away from cities to capitalise on the regional flavour dominating his script. A good chunk of Chennai Express is spoken in Tamil without any subtitles but the Hindamil/Tamindi screenplay ensures nothing is lost in translation or lack of it. Although there's no dearth of linguistic irreverence, the humour that actually works has nothing to do with word plays like kaafi/kaapi or Teriyama/Teri maa. The spunk here comes from attitude, the actors' compliance to be wholeheartedly loony, in enjoying not merely enacting, silly. And so it's easy to lap up the spontaneity with which Rahul taunts Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer resembling Mukesh Rishi in Gardish ) as 'Hanger pe latke kaale kapde' or Shetty lets his imagination riot as usual with the 'Life of Pi' gag or Deepika pays a creepy tribute to Manjulika's (think Bhool Bhulaiya) tribe. Except that the scrumptious bits like the initially decent meal of a train journey soon makes way for stale leftover that pass off as morning breakfast. Once he runs out of jokes and jeeps to explode, Shetty dodders in classic stereotypes as well as his fondness for saturated colours, tossing in ugly visual effects. Unsure of where to head next or offer any explanation for the delay in the hero-heroine's romantic union, he constructs scenes of contrived sentimentality, laughable drama and extended violence. Ideally, the madcap tone of Chennai Express called for an equally quirky finish. Instead, the previously mousy Shah Rukh returns to his messiah roots bringing up the 66th year of Independence, parenting, women's rights in one breath followed by an endless session of crash, boom, bang simply to drive home his tag line for this Rahul: Never underestimate the power of a common man. The unintentionally funny thing here is the adverse treatment meted at SRK's endorsements -- Videocon-- harbinger of bad news, Pepsi -- an entire crate is banged in his direction and Nokia -- flung outside the train, in the name of embedded marketing. What stays put through and through is SRK's incredible charisma and gusto as he lightens the screen with his unabashed buffoonery, visibly enjoying his role as entertainer while lampooning it just the same. His effervescence is met with dazzling reciprocation in Deepika Padukone's 'Meena Washing Powder Meena' who gets top billing in the opening credits. There's so much control in the stunner's performances since the last couple of films. And her dynamic comic timing even against faulty sensibilities is part of that evolution. Finally, did I get my ten laughs? Well, I came *this* close. By the time the count had reached seven, Chennai Express decided to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama.</Review>

Others are just nonsense. Chennai Express, directed by Rohit Shetty, ticks both boxes. More than a quarter of the film is in Tamil, and hence incomprehensible if you're unfamiliar with the language. The rest is a stew of puerile humor, lazy stereotypes, and way-over-the-top acting from a star who appears to be trying too hard. Shah Rukh Khan, who's provided enough evidence to convince us that he can do comedy effortlessly (remember 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa', 'DDLJ', and 'Main Hoon Na'?), spends a chunk of this film referencing his earlier hits, and bouncing off the walls like the Energizer bunny. Could he possibly be overworking himself to compensate for the film's tired writing? Because it's clear from 'Chennai Express' that Shetty has launched an elaborate expedition with a plot so thin, it could give a paper dosa a run for its money. That plot involves SRK's character, Rahul (yes, again!) boarding the 'Chennai Express', intending to sneak off to Goa to vacation with his buddies, although he's tasked with immersing his grandpa's ashes in Rameswaram. But when he encounters Meena (Deepika Padukone), who's on the run from her father (Sathyaraj), a don in a Tamil Nadu village, Rahul is tricked into going back with her and pretending to be her fiance. This comes with its own set of complications - Meena is betrothed to the hulking, glowering Thambabali (Niketan Dheer), which is why she made a mad dash from her village in the first place. As Rahul and Meena scramble all over South India to escape daddy's goons, we struggle to catch up. Chennai Express attempts to marry the puppy-dog sentimentality of a typical Shah Rukh Khan romance with the broad humor and the crash-bang-boom thrills of a Rohit Shetty action comedy. But the film does little justice to either genre. A big reason for that is the lethargic pacing. Shetty has pulled off cornier stories in the past, delivering gags and stunts at breakneck speed. This film, however, is a tough slog because the jokes aren't funny, and the set pieces entirely rehashed. In place of a real performance, Shah Rukh resorts to the sort of facial gymnastics that could shame an Olympian. To endure this indulgence, you have to be a die-hard fan. Deepika Padukone, meanwhile, stays firmly in character throughout. Her heavily accented Meena delivers some genuine laughs, particularly during one terrific scene in which she sleep-talks as if she were possessed. Six years after debuting opposite Shah Rukh in Om Shanti Om, she displays comic chops to rival his. The pair doesn't get much scope to ignite romantic chemistry, save for one scene after interval, when Shah Rukh carries Deepika in his arms, and proceeds to climb up 300 steps to a temple on the top of a hill. His face bathed in sweat, his eyes alive with intensity, Shah Rukh takes each step with unflappable commitment, and Deepika can't take her eyes off him. Alas, moments like these are in short supply here. What you get are insipid songs, a long sermon on women empowerment, more cars being flipped like pancakes and so many references to 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' that you wish you were sitting in Maratha Mandir watching that film instead. I'm going with a generous two out of five for 'Chennai Express'. How to put this politely? It's a big, fat bore. A bloated vanity project for an actor capable of so much more.</Review>

I went into Chennai Express dreading I would be doused, doused I tell you, with a staggering number of stereotypes, and that I would spend the film flinching and grimacing and counting the minutes. But as Chennai Express began chugging along, I found myself guffawing in a place. Or two. The laughs came intermittently through the first half, and I was still sitting in my seat at the interval. And then it turned into the same old story : the plot, which was thinner than a self-respecting wafer to start with, just gives up and dies, and the lead pair, Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone stop talking to each other (even as Padukone's thickly-accented "main aati, aur thum jaati" out-Mehmoods Mehmood at his most outre) and begin posturing. They have no competition from anything else : the trademark Shetty bang bang ? car chases, jeeps blowing up, large groups of people charging at each other ? is by now more eye glaze than ever. This could have been a good caper, in which madcap characters race around the countryside with other madcap characters in hot pursuit. Especially when Shah Rukh Khan is so willingly sending himself up as only he can, with such a knowing nudge-and-wink that you smile despite yourself. "Rahul", he introduces himself to Meenamaa (Padukone): "naam toh nahin suna hoga". You know you are being set up, and yet you can't help being amused. The amusement lasts only momentarily, and you are left feeling sorry at the waste. Rahul wants to head to Goa to party with his pals, but he gets on to the Chennal Express instead, to fulfil his late dadaji's dying wish. On that train hops the beauteous Meenakshi aka Meenamma, on the run from her appa (Sathyaraj) who is some kind of a don in a Tamil Nadu village, and who wants to marry her off. One thing leads to another, and the two reach said village. Towering hulk who is also would-be-groom (Dheer) arrives to growl and snarl. A phalanx of dark-complexioned fierce fellows shake sickles at Rahul, who is left to face a barrage of rapid-fire Tamilian yakkity yak, and a Meenamma who dimples prettily whenever she is given a chance, and a film that rapidly heads, ha ha, south.</Review>

This time Shah Rukh Khan, in a bid to prove he still remains at the top of his game, is out gunning to score with lungi power. Chennai Express was always about giving SRK a wacky makeover. On cue, the superstar's latest co-production imagines a set-up he has hardly ever been a part of - loud and gaudy, packaged with all that jazz you expect in a film created Rohit Shetty ishtyle. If Shah Rukh goes for the Chennai Cut (which has worked wonders for Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn lately), Rohit lays out quite a masala gala. The standard Rohit Shetty film always looks like the script was added as an afterthought, and his latest is no exception. In that sense, Chennai Express is a crafty commercial product more than a film, riding the diligent hype SRK has drummed up over the past few months. The hype will ensure a whopper of an opening, and the circus on screen that uses every trick in the Rohit Shetty book should keep all fans happy. Cars fly. Hero flies. Villains fly. Hero and villains go for elaborate dhishoom doses. The naach-gaana drill has hordes of colourful extras in the backdrop - hordes so large they must have needed trucks to transport them to the scenic outdoors. Yeah, there is the patented Rohit Shetty bag of slapstick gags, too. The director uses it to set up a few spoof tricks, lampooning everything from SRK's biggest films (you won't miss the merry winks at DDLJ, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dil Se or Main Hoon Na) to his own Golmaal films to the stock Rajinikanth image. A witty one about Shah Rukh's advancing age is particularly not to be missed. Essentially, this film is all about imagining SRK's trademark loverboy Rahul in a new set-up. He is called Rahul in this film, too. The name, you realise, is Shah Rukh Khan's assurance to fans that he isn't moving away from the image that created his superstardom, no matter the Chennai-style spread all around. He is still very much the nice guy, at heart a lover, as opposed to the rugged macho heroes Bollywood flicks with a South flavour normally peddle. An energetic first half pulsates with regular laughs, as Mumbai boy Rahul find himself aboard Chennai Express by default. He meets the feisty Tamil girl Meenamma (Deepika Padukone) and twist in Rahul's tale comes with her. Caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, there are plenty of misadventures in store. If brainless fun needs some brainwork to leave an impact, Chennai Express reveals a lot of it in the early hour. Then, as Rahul and Meenamma find themselves on the run from her extended family of goons, the narrative simply falls flat in the second half. It's almost as if Rohit lost interest in his own film after a point. Confusion over language difference is a convenient excuse to create gags all through. Puerile as it seems, it works in a way it can only in a Rohit Shetty film. Rohit has always operated with a mantra of excesses, arrogantly snubbing all intelligent criticism it may draw. He doesn't reveal any overt ambition to redefine the Bollywood comedy with this film either. Chennai Express banks largely on its lead pair to keep going. Shah Rukh is full of vim as ever, and you will love his madcap ride if you are willing to discount the odd ham bursts. Deepika's Meenamma adds a cutesexy charm to the film. She gets the full o' beans vibes about her act just right though her accented 'accented Hindi' could seem slightly taxing. They make a smashing duo in the supercharged Lungi Dance, though almost all the other songs are glossover fare. Chennai Express is a loud and crazy experience, so what if you might just forget all of it even as you hit the exit door after the show. It's got the lungi power while it lasts</Review>

It's true of Rang De Basanti director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, an ambitious account of the first 27 years or so of celebrated Indian sprinter Milkha Singh's roller-coaster life. Over an exhausting 3 hours and 7 minutes, the film, starring Farhan Akhtar as Milkha, details the athlete's journey from a boy displaced during Partition to his early years in a gang of petty thieves, followed by his recruitment in the Indian army from where he went on to become a sports hero. All this is revealed in a long flashback by Milkha's earliest coach, Gurudev Singh (an endearing Pavan Malhotra), during a train journey with Pandit Nehru's advisor, while pointing out why Milkha has turned down the Prime Minister's invitation to lead a sports delegation to Pakistan. (The explanation for that decision, painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain, is clumsily used as a suspenseful cliffhanger in the film). There are moments of great pathos here, and an inspiring lesson on the importance of perseverance and hard work. But it all moves at a snail's pace, even as the drama of Milkha's rise on the race track is punctured routinely by too many songs, overlong romantic tracks, and the kind of 'commercial-movie trappings' that are counterproductive to a film of this nature. Biopics, however panoramic in scope, usually boil down to a greatest-hits collection, and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, for all its sepia-toned flashbacks and terrific training sequences is no exception. It's a shame Mehra and screenwriter Prasoon Joshi adopt a manipulative, melodramatic approach to highlight Milkha's achievements and justify his failures. In the film's opening scene, a key moment in Milkha's professional career, he loses the lead in the 1960 Rome Olympics when he turns back, apparently because he was haunted by an image from his troubled past. In another scene, where Milkha wins an important race despite being badly injured, Mehra swells the score even as the bandages covering Milkha's wounds dramatically come off as he inches towards the finish line. And don't even get me started on the Gadar-esque finale in Pakistan, where Milkha must fulfill the dream of every Indian by beating a rival from our neighboring nation. Never before has slow motion and background music been so abused in a film! Not everything comes apart though. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy delivers some great tunes, particularly Zinda that is rendered with suitable energy by Siddharth Mahadevan. Mehra himself stages a rousing middle portion in Ladakh, where Milkha trains tirelessly with the India coach following a disappointment at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. This montage, gorgeously filmed, is a fine reminder of Farhan Akhtar's complete submission to the part. The actor in fact, and his committed performance, is the film's biggest strength. From his convincing accent and his dialogue delivery to the sheer beast of his physical presence, Farhan is riveting as Milkha. But Joshi's script, bursting at its seams with too much information that serves little purpose other than to establish Milkha as someone with a wholesome personality, shortchanges Akhtar with the weight of its mawkish melodrama. Divya Dutta, as Milkha's doting sister, and the only character in the film who appears to have never aged, hits all the predictable notes. Sonam Kapoor, meanwhile, in a smaller part, as Milkha's first love, brings a quiet freshness to her scenes. The film itself is well intentioned and shines a light on an important figure. But it's too long and too unfocused to leave a lasting impression. I'm going with two-and-a-half out of five for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Watch it for Farhan Akhtar's sincere performance.</Review>
      <Review Id="7" Name="SUkanya Verma" Expected="ThumbsDown" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-bhaag-milkha-bhaag-disappoints/20130712.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="12th July 2013" Likes="" Rating="2.5/5">You know the thing about unfortunate run-outs in cricket? Sometimes a batsman inching closer towards a knockout innings runs so eagerly in between wickets that by the time he gets on the other side, his off-guard co-batsman has not even started. Click! Although Bhaag Milkha Bhaag involves a completely different sport, the aforementioned scenario sits as an appropriate analogy to describe how Farhan Akhtar's zeal is let down by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's distracted story-telling. Legendary athlete Milkha Singh's life, on whom this feature is based, is truly inspiring and filled with a lot of exciting chapters that in the tradition of most biopics are dramatised and somewhat exaggerated to render it gripping and gritty. It's a filmmaker's call as to what extent he will intensify the actual with the imagined and haggle with style over substance. Sadly, in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Mehra goes overboard in his bid to look epic and promoting ad film aesthetics that focus on Farhan's remarkable physicality as he trains against Ladakh's majestic terrains, or swims in Australia's blue ocean with a pretty local in vintage swimwear or has recurring visions of the dreadful hour he witnessed the massacre of his folks that appear like a tacky VFX mash-up between Imran Khan's dreams in Jaane Tu...Yaa Jaane Naa and the dark, sepia-toned skies of Zack Snyder's 300. Mehra's comfort with histrionics infused Rang De Basanti with its hard-hitting rebellion but that was the whole point behind its story. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag fails to achieve that level of clarity or coherence, primarily because of Prasoon Joshi's faulty screenplay and sleepy editing by P Bharti, which appears both overwhelmed and clueless about putting together the many chapters of a sportsman's eventful existence. So Bhaag Milkha Bhaag adopts the contrived route wherein everyone competing with the titular hero is entirely nefarious and out to break his legs or bully him like those Rajput dudes in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander and everything Pakistan implies hostile like those arrogant tyrants in every second jingoistic Bollywood flick. Moreover, this indecision to project Bhaag Milkha Bhaag as either a) a man dealing with the painful memories of his childhood in partition era, b) the blossoming of a happy-go-lucky army man into a superstar athlete or c) why an individual doesn't want to visit Pakistan overlaps too often in this three-hour plus, flashback-within-flashback drama to ruin a potentially promising premise. The last point, especially, makes no sense. It could be answered in the same breath that it was asked by K K Raina but poor Pawan Malhotra is handed the unpleasant task of recounting the entire story, including Milkha's fleeting romance (which has NOTHING to do with the query) and other digressions before the film reaches its extended finishing line. It's not that BMB is devoid of glorious moments. Milkha's camaraderie with his friends in the army, especially his doodh-chanting aspirations in a cross-country run, his ghee-feasting gusto outside the police chowki or his slap-filled outburst at himself after losing a race in Melbourne. Also, the portions with the younger Milkha (Japtej Singh) are quite memorable owing to this young actor's exuberant smile, effortless fervour boosted by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's roaring soundtrack and Binod Pradhan's beautiful frames, which nimbly change with the mood of its story. It's also a relief to see Prakash Raj in a role that's far less bombastic than what he usually does in Bollywood. Others like Malhotra, Raina, Divya Dutta (she exudes more emotion than all of BMB), provide the narrative its mandatory sighs and sobs but it's Dalip Tahil's uninspired, laughable casting as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru that truly baffles. There's also Sonam Kapoor with her carefully-styled messy hair in a role that lasts a few minutes. She's no gaon ki Punjaban but with such short screen time, there's little damage one can do. Ultimately, the only reason to watch this disappointment is Farhan Akhtar's career-best delivery. He visibly labours to acquire a stunning physicality, a body language that knows legs that run from legs that race and rinse off the urban texture of his personality to become the Flying Sikh who overcomes extraordinary battles -- of mind, body and society to emerge a victor. And he does, leaving everyone behind.</Review>

No, I am Milkha Singh. This is one of those legendary jokes that typifies a couple of things: Punjabi humour in all its quirky broadness, and the man who is supposed to have said it, the legendary athlete who broke records on national and international tracks, and became a byword for sporting excellence in India. I've always thought the line was apocryphal. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's film, 'inspired by a true life' grounds the joke in a moment, and cements the tone of the film. Carefully skirting the tag of a bio-pic, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag manages to tell the story of Milkha Singh, as enacted by Farhan Akhtar, while giving us, tiresomely, all the familiar bells and whistles of a Bollywood entertainer with the naach-gaana, and the rona-dhona. The story of Milkha Singh is inspirational, doubtless. And Mehra leaves, literally, not one stone unturned (and adds a few of his own, doubtless) in this three hour and some saga, which takes us from Milkha's childhood in then Punjab-now Pakistan, the trauma of Partition and being torn from his (Milkha's) family, his lawless youth, his joining the Indian Army and gaining respectability. And then learning the joys of running. For himself, and for the honour of his nation. But the way the director tells it is much less inspiring. It's almost as if he needs to talk up his film in order to entice us to watch it. Why, you ask yourself, when you see a burst of sporting glory, the kind that becomes goose-flesh immortal every time someone refers to it even, does the director need to dress up his story so much that it nearly drowns? The face of a winner, at the end of a tough race, is such a win in itself. Is there any need to underline it, just in case we miss the point, with loud background music? When the film is left to tell the story unvarnished, it has several felt passages. And most of them belong to Milkha's childhood. Little Milkha and his plump friend, wading through a river, tossing a few lines between them as friends are wont to. His being made to be a murga in the tiny village school, and colloquial talk of his thui ( backside, reddening at the touch of a master's chhadi/stick). His strong love for older sister (Dutta) which keeps him going in adulthood. It is a strong segment, with Art Malik, playing Milkha's father, and who exhorts him to 'run', to flee to the other side of the newly formed, bloody border. In short order, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag starts getting overlaid by too much drama and mawkishness. Farhan Akhtar is consistently likeable but not always believable as the eponymous hero. He does everything he needs to: the liking for duddh (milk) that gets him to start the back-breaking training, his early attraction to a pretty Punjaban (Kapoor), the little flirtations he indulges in (one with a saucy Aussie girl in Melbourne), and then straining every sinew for a win. You can see Akhtar's hard work, both on his physique, and the way he runs on the track and field and everywhere else, as well as his accent. But the moment you place him alongside a Pawan Malhotra, who plays his Army coach, and who speaks Punjabi just the way it ought to be spoken, guttural, from the heart, that you know that difference between acting a part and the real deal. As the Indian athletics coach who accompanies Milkha in his latter journeys, Yograj Singh is effective. So is Prakash Raj as the stentorian, if a tad stereotypical, Army senior. Dutta, too, as the loving badi behen leaves a mark. Kapoor's presence, as the love angle, is mercifully brief. It is meant to be sweet, that little interlude, but you can see it for what it is, playacting. If the film had kept it pared, toning down the trumpets which blare every time something momentous is about to happen, it would have been a more powerful testament to an all-time sporting great. As it has turned out, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is more the overlong, overblown Singing-Dancing-Flying Sikh, than just the triumphal, true Flying Sikh.</Review>

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, as the promos promised, essentially explores the man behind the phenomenon, considered one of the greatest Indian sportsmen ever. If Milkha is a living legend, his life brims with drama more audacious than any run-of-the-mill film script. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra creates fascinating fiction out of facts, although he could have kept it shorter. At 187 minutes, the film includes too many subplots to remain cohesive all through. Three-film-old Mehra's career so far has swung to and fro extremes. His first, Aks, defined confusion as did his last, Delhi-6. In between the two there was Rang De Basanti, a film that inspired a whole nation. The law of averages seems to work in Mehra's favour this time. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, aimed at inspiring through its story of an icon, shouldn't have much trouble impressing Bollywood buffs. The film draws its title from the last words Milkha as a boy heard from his father, in the wake of Partition riots. The communal violence of the era forms the fulcrum in laying out Milkha's formative phase. It hints at what went into creating the resilience of the man we would come to know as the Flying Sikh in the years to come. Milkha's story divides itself roughly into two halves. There is the restless, angered youth, coming to terms with Partition that cost him his family, and taking to crime as a refugee for sustenance. Then there is the spirited youth who gets into the Army, where his talent as a sprinter is first spotted. Prasoon Joshi's script moves in time cycles between past and present to set up the story of these two Milkhas. The salad days in the barracks provide an engaging watch. Joshi is vivid in imagination of Milkha's time in the Army. The element of camaraderie inherent in this early phase of his life leaves scope for random humour and emotions alike. The film could have done away with the imposed mush quota. Sonam Kapoor's 20-minute appearance as Milkha's 'romantic heroine' cuts down pace, as do his subsequent dalliances with an Australian girl (Rebecca Breeds, she gets an almost equal footage too). For a biopic mounted on a lavish 30-crore scale, those though are expected frills. Farhan has always scored as a natural, though mostly exuding urban cool in films such as Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Playing Milkha lets him break the mould. He underplays every emotion to impress. Among the prop cast, Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha's first coach) and Divya Dutta (as his elder sister) steal the show despite small roles. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to inspire without getting too complex about it and succeeds. Just for that, it is worth a watch.</Review>

Take Chak De India for sample or even the exemplary Paan Singh Tomar. It's the perseverance of the lead protagonists, their strife for excellence and their indefatigable spirit that strikes a chord with people making the stories cult. However, the fact that you are making a biopic doesn't just work. It should be crisp, should be told with exact conviction with which the life of the protagonist was lived and only then it becomes a good film. Milkha Singh aka the Flying Sikh's biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to achieve that excellence. Does it succeed? We tell you. It all starts from Milkha Singh losing the only race in his entire life, that in Rome, Olympics in 1960. We are then taken to the time when Milkha Singh has already attained the success that he set out to achieve. But he refuses to run if sent to Pakistan, the country he detests. Three people, two of Singh's coaches and a messenger of Pandit Jawaharwal Nehru are sent to convince Singh to take part. The story then moves into series of intercutting of past and present where the coaches narrate the reason why Milkha is against running in Pakistan. We all know that Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's (ROM) most ambitious venture BMB took almost two years for completion. We also know that Farhan Akhtar literally put his heart and soul in this project. But sadly, the film falls short in impressing even half as much as the efforts the latter has put. It's clearly ROM's flawed and extremely stretched story-telling that kills any thrill there ever could be in Milkha Singh's real life story. Moreover, the over-dramatization of episodes from Singh's life which actually don't contribute to the story at all makes matters worse. There are way too many episodes converted into numerous sub-plots narrated through a non-linear narrative pattern which actually don't just hog up the run time but also lead to a tiring film. Clocking three hours and eight minutes, BMB also gives you glimpses of Gadar, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar and Paan Singh Tomar, more like the latter for both the stories revolved around runners. So you have Milkha Singh taking part in athletics for Milk and Eggs and later finding it tough to adjust to shoes for he always ran bare feet clearly reminding you of Irrfan Khan of Paan Singh Tomar. To add to the agony are the songs used aplenty, much worse, some in slow motion which clearly are forced into the film without any relevance. The songs are jarring and definitely don't add value to the movie. Renowned cinematographer Binod Pradhan does a splendid job with the camera capturing certain sequences brilliantly however, it's ROM's drawback again for using those scenes in a gimmicky fashion. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works only and only for Farhan Akhtar. The actor has raised the bar of acting to a whole new level and deserves to be lauded. Right from getting his physicality right to his diction, body language everything is remarkable. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand barely has much to do and even at that her sub-plot just consumes a lot of time. The rest of the cast like Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh, Dalip Tahil are passable. To sum it up, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an extremely dramatised, glossy version of a biopic which fails to connect owing to its extensive run time and exaggeration.</Review>

While Udaan was the coming of age tale of a small-town teenager going head to head with his despotic father, 'Lootera' is steeped in old-fashioned romance. At the heart of this film is a young couple faced with insurmountable odds. And yet, it isn't so much the film's story, but in its telling that Motwane woos you. Skillfully combining the key tools of cinema - pictures, sound, and music - he delivers a transcendent experience that's hard to describe in words. 'Lootera' opens in 1950s West Bengal, where a new democracy is changing archaic laws and reclaiming princely estates. Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) is the indulged daughter of an old zamindar (Barun Chanda) from Manekpur. She lives in a sheltered world, but you can see her straining for independence as she secretly drives the family car when she's out of her father's sight. Her world collides with that of archaeologist Varun (Ranveer Singh), who is invited to stay as a houseguest when he's on an assignment to excavate a site on her father's property. Varun and Pakhi are inexorably drawn to each other, even though he knows in his heart that he must leave her someday. The film's plot is inspired partly by O Henry's famous short story The Last Leaf, yet Motwane gives it a romantic, even thrilling twist. There is a lyrical quality to the couple's exchanges in 'Lootera'. Varun and Pakhi communicate with their eyes at the start, then their relationship deepens over shared dreams and long conversations. Pakhi confesses that she wants to be a writer, spinning stories in her Dalhousie home. Varun, in turn, has the soul of an artist and wishes to paint a masterpiece someday. The director establishes a leisurely pace that matches the period, and a picnic scene in particular, where the couple is gently teased by their friends, feels straight out of a Merchant-Ivory drama. In the second half, Motwane opts for muted colours and sticks with those interminably long silences as the couple is reunited under very different circumstances. There is attention to the smallest details in 'Lootera', like the art direction, the lighting, and particularly Mahendra Shetty's intuitive camera that knows just how to capture the lovely landscapes as well as the somber mood of later scenes. Amit Trivedi's beautiful songs and background score add another layer of feeling to the aching love story here. Yet it's hard to resign yourself to some convenient coincidences in the plot, or even the naivete that filters in towards the end. In a film so close to perfection, the small lapses are hard to hide. What you can't find fault in are the pitch-perfect performances. Barun Chanda deftly marries a father's vulnerability with the arrogance of a zamindar who believes he is entitled. Vikram Massey, playing Varun's Dev Anand-obsessed friend, is cheeky and unyielding in equal measure, while Adil Hussain does a good job as a hard-nosed cop on the heels of a criminal. Yet 'Lootera' belongs to its two leads, Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha, who do their best work here. Shifting seamlessly from feisty to fragile to bitter, Sonakshi delivers a deeply heartfelt performance that feels mature beyond her years. Ranveer, for his part, brings a quiet sensitivity to Varun, and occasionally a smoldering intensity. Offering a finely internalized performance, he leaves a lasting impression. Moving without resorting to melodrama, 'Lootera' is bittersweet in the end. Formerly an assistant to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Motwane reveals the same command over technique, and a similar love for sweeping visuals. But unlike Bhansali's recent films, Motwane never distracts you with his tapestry. I'm going with four of five for 'Lootera'. Drop whatever else you're doing, and soak in this love saga.</Review>

The ache in the heart comes as a welcome relief, but a little too late. The journey towards the end is shot through with beauty, one painterly frame after another evoking admiration, but it did not touch me. And that is where Vikramaditya Motwane's film becomes a disappointing second act, after his magnificent debut Udaan. Lootera, set in the early '50s, tells the story of Varun (Singh) and Pakhi (Sinha) in a manner most Indian filmmakers have forgotten. Motwane knows how to pace his tale to match an old-wordly tempo: it is a unhurried build-up of time and place that takes you to the village of Manikpur in West Bengal in 1953, poised at the grand lifestyle of the zamindars about to go bust, and slides you into the opulent bubble that the local zamindar ( Chanda) and his daughter Pakhi live in. The arrival of the young, personable Varun and his companion (Massey) to set up an archeological dig around the haveli brings the first fissures. You can see why the motherless Pakhi, who has found solace only in her father's doting arms till now, will gravitate towards Varun. But I did not feel any reciprocal heat from Varun. He has his reasons for keeping his distance, because he is not who he claims he is. But when there is youth and passion, all reason flees. She shows her longing clearly. From him, you want more, not unreadable sidelong glances, and a stealing away when no one is looking. The main hook that should have kept you with them, is missing. The first half, which should have been the dance of desire between these two people, is impacted by this inexplicable remoteness. Varun's back story, with a no-good uncle (Zakaria), is clunkily done, and there are entire stretches where you are disconnected. The story, post half time, catches traction, and for me becomes the film. Almost. Time has elapsed. From a huge haveli with countless rooms, Pakhi has now moved to a small family guesthouse in Dalhousie, having lost her father, and other treasures that cocooned her during her growing up years. As she struggles with heartbreak, and a terminal illness (the kind that brings blood to a handkerchief, such an old-timey disease), Varun comes back to her life, and that takes both to the brink. Post interval, you can see better the influence of the great O'Henry short story (The Last Leaf), on which it is based. It is a more intimate canvas, and you finally see two lovers striving towards each other, breaths mingling. The bit parts, played by a cop (Hussain) who is after the fleet-footed Varun, and the housekeeper (Dutta) of the guesthouse, remain bit parts. The cop is responsible for an implausible plot point, which seems to be put in there to allow Singh to loosen up and show his feelings, both to the girl he had left behind, and to us. As the film quickens, so do we: Motwane is in form here, as he gives us doomed lovers spiraling out of control, leading to a memorable climax. But I wish Singh had been freed up more. His slate is bland. Much of the first half of the film is too, being revved up by its background music. The good parts of the film can be divvied up between cinematograher Mahendra Shetty's wizardry with the camera, the terrific, spot-on Barun Chanda, and Sonakshi Sinha. She plays Pakhi with surety, even when her eyes are too heavily ringed denoting sickness, channeling her emotions without holding back, allowing herself to get ugly while weeping. She is the real looteri; her Lootera should have had more heft. So should have the film. It has left me with some indelible scenes which are sheer poetry, but this is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I did.</Review>
      <Review Id="13" Name="Raja Sen" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-lootera-is-an-absolute-masterpiece/20130704.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="4rth July, 2013" Likes="" Rating="5/5">"Once upon a time." Those are four magic words, four words that promise us the world, adventure and romance and fantasy and drama. The starter's pistol to any fairytale, they offer up immediate escape: "a time" is never now, you see, and we're instantly whisked away from the humdrum of our everyday. Our imagination, like a suddenly alert hound, perks up its ears and begins to underscore even ordinary narratives with flourishes the narrator never spells out. With those four words in place, anything can follow. Vikramaditya Motwane understands this well, which is why his masterful adaptation of a classic O Henry story, nearly a hundred years old, begins with a father caressing a daughter with far older folklore. As the ailing daughter listens, the story snaps a character's neck, and the bassline in her head begins to thrum. Lootera makes it crystal clear right from the start that it is an old-world tale -- one involving buried treasure, no less, and rhymes about lizards and rats -- and then, with its sleeves rolled up, begins to enchant. The film opens gently, with a cough. The girl is a writer, the daughter of a Bengali zamindar -- naturally she'd have studied at Shantiniketan? That's what the boy rightly assumes, popping into her path as an archaeologist, but now shoehorned into her service as an art teacher. He pretends, she indulges, and one thing leads inevitably to another until we come thudding across to that heartbreaking finale we inaccurately thought we'd braced ourselves for. An exquisite but hard-to-translate word in Bengali called "aadikheta" means, in my clumsy approximation, an appetite for being pampered (worded as if pampering were a sweetmeat), and I can think of no better word for Motwane's heroine, Pakhi. A feisty girl who has largely been bred on affection by her doting father, her intelligence doesn't get in the way of her wondering, during the abolition of zamindari in the early 1950s, just what the government will do by seizing their gardens. So used is she to having her way that when a man thwarts her overtures, the feeling of rejection is too unfamiliar to register. Instead, she is merely confounded. Click! Her fellow, Varun, is a more street-smart sort, one who might not watch a film as soon as it releases but knows enough to cheekily make a reference to it later. When we first meet him, he's calm, unhurried and mostly unflappable -- playing an art-teacher might be a stretch for him, however. Nevertheless, he gamely calls drawing leaves easy, and confidently daubs at the canvas with green paint. The contrast between the two characters is delightful, and the actors conjure up a fierce, throbbing chemistry. Sonakshi Sinha plays Pakhi beautifully, creating a character who is immaculately wide-eyed and possesses casual, yet unmistakable, grace. It is a performance that starts off dreamily soft and turns harder, and she does well-etched dialogue justice like few actresses can. There's a discernible vulnerability to Pakhi throughout the film, and Sinha brings out this fragility perfectly without ever overplaying it. Ranveer Singh matches her step for step, using his lower lip to marvelous effect. He curls it when angry, juts it out when thoughtful and lets it hang loose (and, finally, frostbitten) when he has nothing to say. And again, he plays it close to the chest, never straying from the pitch of the film: when he stammers on the word "landscape", he lightly labours the L instead of actually repeating it. He looks good as a quiet pinup, a vintage hero in high-waisted trousers, but it is when he bedraggedly lets his seams show that Singh is at his best. He even snarls like Heathcliff. And despite all this proficiency with dialogue -- which extends to the other great performers in the film, the veteran Barun Chanda (who uses words like "umartaraaz" with near-Utpal Dutt gravitas) and the very likable Vikrant Massey, who throws in a Devsaab impression -- the very best moments in Lootera are the entirely wordless ones. This is largely due to the remarkable craft shown by cinematographer Mahendra J Shetty, who has composed a film where every frame melts into the other with a most lyrical ebb and flow. Lootera is a gorgeous, gorgeous film, one that uses its period setting affectionately, with loving detail, and not exploitatively, as our cinema is wont to do. Shetty pores over it all -- from the lace curtains to the mosquito nets, from the checkerboard floors of the old mansion to the frozen-over remnants of a roadside shrine to a dashboard light surrounded by open-air darkness -- but the way he frames his actors' faces may be the greatest masterclass on offer. Both Sinha and Singh have distinctive noses, and rather than divert attention away from them the film embraces the contrast, highlighting it by a profile shot of the two in the same frame. Before we encounter Sonakshi's nose we see that of a Durga effigy, and the uniqueness of the actress' nose is thrown automatically into sharp relief. Later, when Sinha's angry, the lens is positioned to make her nose look like a menhir; it's always intentional, and it's always captivating. Singh's is a more angular nose, one that looks pointy as sweat drips off it during a dimly lit-scene, and the first time the two kiss, it is preceded by an eskimo-style rubbing of the noses. Many cinematographers can conjure up moody shadows and beautiful frames, but what is on show here -- as Sinha looks through a big magnifying glass to make her eyes appear huge, as the Bengali-girl stereotype dictates -- is so much more special, and Shetty is clearly a wizard. All this while Motwane plays The Thieving Magpie. And I don't just mean the Rossellini overture that automatically reminds me of The Castafiore Emerald. Lootera deftly pays tribute to Guru Dutt's first film by way of song and name of the villain, and borrows a disease from Ritwik Ghatak's heartwrenching Meghe Dhaka Tara. All this while genius composer Amit Trivedi uncharacteristically steals his main theme from a bad English film, as if some pickpocketry was the price of entry. In light of what the titular protagonist does, perhaps this adaptation could be titled The Last Thief. Either way, this is a film worth the grandest of larceny. Motwane's direction is so assured and confident that this scarcely feels like his second feature. The script is clearly one he believes in, and the film is resultantly free of false-notes. Even the few moments that feel like narrative missteps turn out to be masterstrokes. And, as exemplified by a breathtaking chase sequence that could result in any number of outcomes, Motwane sides with his story, not with any one of his characters. A film, then, about life, love and leaves. And in the end it comes down to the sort of snow-surrounded tree that you can draw even if you've always had trouble drawing leaves. Magnificent.</Review>

Director Vikramaditya Motawane has constructed an elaborate experiment of a film. A big-budget visual delight starring A-list actors, Lootera's story is simplistic; it's telling self-consciously un-Bollywood, and one that aspires for artistic glory. Set in early post-independence Bengal and Himachal, Lootera is a elaborately dressed but subdued love story of an "archaeologist" and a zamindar's daughter whose father's highbred legacy is struggling to keep with the changing times. The story has much scope for drama but Motwane and co-writer Bhavani Iyer choose to shy away, holding back on the exuberance and elements of surprise (often allowing the audience to be ahead of the characters) and allowing tenderness to take over tautness. The humor is intrinsic, a lot of dialogue is distilled to whispers. While the first half is unhurried and replete with stolen glances, chases across snowy hill stations and some decisive action breathes some life into the the second. Expectedly, the title itself foretells revelations. This subtle film instructs you in a not-so-subtle manner: watch it for its moments (of which there are several), not for what happens next (convenience looms large, cracks are duct-taped over). You are not to be bogged down by logic. Motwane has taken more than a cue from Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the extravagant director he's assisted for over half a decade, and has drawn from his sense of aesthetic in Lootera. This is a purposive choice for a director who has now shown commendable range considering his excellent first film Udaan, as raw an indie can get. And yet similarities between the two films abound. Poignant moments are created by simply not thrusting Bollywood methodology in the filmmaking. Note for example how plot is secondary, it's the characters we're made to invest in. We're sympathetic to their effort to evince their internal battles in words in actions, both that are often knowingly repetitive and yet not jarring. Ranvir Singh and Sonakshi Sinha are at their subtle best with every line of dialog, every expression acutely considered. And yet eventually the film overwhelms the performances. Because the craftsmanship, if anything, is even more impeccable. The highlights of Lootera, the overwhelming reason you may choose to watch this film, lie in the technical departments. There is a sense of purity in Mahendra Shetty's cinematography, luscious with light, undaunted by grain in the dark. A timbre in Kunal Sharma's sound design, especially the way the dialog tracks have been treated, is reminiscent of watching older films in a time before 5.1 (I truly hope this is was intentional and not a result of a bad speaker in the theater I watched it). And finally, Aditya Kanwar's art direction. What startling recreation of period! What incredible attention to detail! Lootera superbly uses technique to immerse you in the period. As much as I'd like to reward Lootera for it's craft I firmly believe that films can only win you over with the ability to tell a story. And this is where Lootera falters. It allows you to drift away. And this is why Udaan, despite struggling on the technical front with its 16 mm camera and stark walls, will always be an exceptional and better film.</Review>

When do they first realize it is love and not just infatuation or physical attraction? In life we often wonder if it is real love that we feel for another person or an emotion with another name. So we seek wisdom of wiser people -- writers, musicians and even filmmakers to guide us through that sense, since real life results in more confusion. In Vikramaditya Motwane?s sophomore project Lootera, the sense of love happens the first time his protagonists -- Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha), the daughter of a landlord and Varun (Ranveer Singh), an archeologist with a mysterious agenda, are involved in a road accident. Pakhi is learning to drive a car on a small rural road and as she looks away she hits a very James Dean-like (although he also reminded me of Gael Garcia Bernal?s Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries) Varun, on a motorcycle. Motwane?s protagonists fall in love in a very quiet way. The director textures into his narrative many parting glances, slight conversations and playful flirtations -- often aided by Amit Trivedi?s seductive score. For Pakhi this is clearly love. It may be her first, but she knows it. But Varun struggles with the ghosts of his past and is driven by the grey shades of his character. When Pakhi confronts Varun, and begs him to acknowledge that he also loves her, he keeps quiet. Love is not easy for him. There is too much holding him back and he cannot say yes even if it is just to please Pakhi, who is clearly hurting. That is such a heartbreakingly beautiful moment in Lootera -- a rare experience in Bollywood films, where love is usually tossed loudly at the audience with a Khulam Khulla Pyar Karenge attitude. In Lootera, Pakhi?s pain at that moment is no less than that of Satyajit Ray?s Charulata when she realizes that her love for Amal will never be fully realised. Motwane?s Lootera (a very fine follow-up to his outstanding Udaan) is lovely film, a blessing for fans of Bollywood who seek real, relatable characters, a meaningful story, a narrative that takes them on a romantic journey, filled with a lot of joy and balanced with some much needed sense of heartache. It is a mature film, but it is also very entertaining -- if that is the sole criteria that drive many of the audiences to thetares to watch Hindi films. Lootera is inspired by O Henry?s slim, 2,500-word long, Greenwich Village-based short story, The Last Leaf. Motwane and his co-writer Bhavani Iyer weave a more detailed and complex narrative around the short story, finely etching out a romance and lace it with a crime that will test the film?s overriding theme of love. There is one peculiar and hard to believe coincidence in the second half of Lootera, but by then I was too much in love with the film to really worry about it. Just two films old, Motwane shows the experience of a filmmaker who could have been making films for many years. Lootera is a period piece -- first half set in rural Bengal in the early 1950s and the second in a cold, grey and snowy Dalhousie. Motwane?s investment in the details -- the cars, the furniture and other artifacts in a Bengali landlord?s house, the costumes and the look of his characters becomes a part of his narrative. His players -- especially Sinha and Singh look like people from that era, very comfortable with their appearances and their surroundings. Singh gives a controlled performance, acting with his smile, eyes, using a low voice and remarkably subduing the tremendous energy the actor has portrayed in his first two films and also displays in his public appearances. Sinha is the real surprise in the film, giving such a fine nuanced performance. As Pakhi she is a young, na?ve dreamer whose heart is first stolen and later broken by a mysterious man. How does the 26-year-old who has appeared in films like Dabangg and Rowdy Rathore become the utterly charming Pakhi in Lootera? Definitely director Motwane has a lot do with that. The songs with Amit Trivedi?s compositions set to Amitabh Bhattacharya?s lyrics are playful (Sawaar Loon) and tragic (the soul of the film Ankahee), and they stay with you long after the film is over. Trivedi is one of the few musicians in Hindi cinema who really knows how to create a meaningful background score -- not in your face loud deafening sounds, but music that eases the audience through the film?s romantic journey. Lootera is a gift, wrapped beautifully in a box, with enough rewards that remind us why we like films in the first place.</Review>

Yet, a harder puzzle to crack is figuring out just how so many talented people could make such a disappointing film. 'No One Killed Jessica' director Raj Kumar Gupta recruits a competent cast, but flounders with a half-cooked script that doesn't know where to go after setting up its delicious premise. Sanju (Emran Hashmi) is a retired cat burglar-turned-full time couch potato who's goaded by his pushy wife Neetu (Vidya Balan) into participating in one last job. What follows is a terrific bank robbery scene involving a security guard and a matka kulfi, the inventive use of movie-star masks, and the unscheduled arrival of a cop who almost foils the plan. Nevertheless, Sanju and his two accomplices - Pandit (Rajesh Sharma) and Idrees (Namit Das) - make off with Rs 35 crore in loot. The entire cash is left with Sanju for the next three months, until the heat from the crime dies down. But when the two goons return to claim their share, they discover Sanju has lost his memory in an accident, and can't remember either them or where he's hidden the bounty. 'Ghanchakkar' has all the ingredients for a dark comedy, yet shaken and stirred they blend like oil and water. The storytelling itself is inconsistent. The plot hits the ground running, never spoon-feeding you with background information you don't need. Then, when the two goons move into the couple's flat while Sanju struggles with his amnesia, you have a set-up ripe for laughs. But Gupta squanders this potential with one too many dinner table scenes banging on about the same joke involving Neetu's cooking. Frustration sets in during the film's flabby middle portion where nothing much really happens. The angry goons want their money...Sanju can't remember a thing...He chases clues that lead nowhere...They bash the living daylights out of him. This routine is repeated over and over again till the line: "Paise kahan hain?" becomes embedded in your brain like a pesky metal chip! And well before it's ultimately revealed in film's the climax, you've guessed the suspense already. It's all such a shame because some things work nicely. The local train becomes an unlikely 'conference room' where the goons hatch their plans, and a running joke about a vegetable-bearing commuter is genuinely funny. The cast too, hits all the right notes. Vidya Balan offers a particularly uninhibited performance as the garrulous, fashion-disaster of a housewife; the kind of part few leading ladies would venture near, or competently pull off. Emraan Hashmi is suitably befuddled, but struggles to shine under the limited scope of his role. The two leads slip easily into the shoes of a couple stuck in a humdrum marriage. As the desperate goons slowly losing their patience, Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das are first-rate. An unlikely team, Sharma's manner is almost polite as the older Pandit, while Namit Das turns Idrees into a hot-headed, trigger-happy lout. In one scene that goes from icky to whacky, we watch as Idrees, midway through a raunchy phone call, ups and chases after Sanju in his underwear. These inspired moments then are few and far between in this lazily scripted film that leaves you bored and searching for the nearest exit. I'm going with two out of five for 'Ghanchakkar'. The money is found in the end, but that's 2 hours and 17 minutes of your life that you'll never see again!</Review>

Ghanchakkar sets up trying-to-go-straight safe-breaker Sanju, and his blowsy trying-to-be fashion-forward wife Neetu, and a couple of rogues, around a bank heist, and lets them loose. This could have been a hoot, but the execution lets down the premise, and the film remains one of those that could have been edgier and funnier. It isn't that Emraan and Vidya, playing the married couple squabbling over minor things, are not given a few laugh-out-loud situations. Raj Kumar Gupta, who's done Aamir and No One Killed Jessica before this, gives Sanjay and Neetu a cracking opening, involving bad cooking, resigned eating, and spousal sulks. Post the dining, there is the bedding. And here, where very few Bollywood movies venture with any imagination, the director gifts us an occasional smile. Balan wears wicked red horns and fishtail tights with flourish: she's all bondage hot-and-ready, and Hashmi who usually gets to kiss and leave his lovelies, lets her make the first move. Two shady fellows, Pandit (Sharma) and Idris (Das), enter their placid lives, enticing Sanju to get back to his tools and a bank vault stuffed with a great deal of cash. The booty, stashed in a suitcase, disappears. The rest of the film has these four characters searching for it, shooting suspicious glances at each other, being stymied by dead ends. This is where the film could have quickened, but it slackens instead, leaving Balan to provide a chuckle or two in her hatti katti Punjaban avatar, her accent slipping more than her deeply cut negligees. But the film doesn't make of its characters' quirks as much as it could have. The Sharma-Das duo has some moments, but is essentially flat. Pretty much like a running gag that starts out funny and ends up as an eye-glaze. And that leads me to a question: are four characters too few (there are a couple of others who show up for a scene or two, but it is with the foursome that all the action rests) for a two hour film? Like some spouses who need additional spice to keep interest from flagging, the unexpected appearance of an extra character perks up the film, and gives us a near-rousing end. Nice wrap, making you wish the rest of the film was as sharp.</Review>

First, a deftly written and executed set up that draws you into the film and at mid-point leaves you wanting a lot more but eventually lets you down. Second, exceptional handling of the actors to get exactly what he wants out of them. Take NOKJ for example. The film's second half lacks the tension its subject so desperately requires even though every time she is on screen, Rani Mukerji vitalizes the narrative and carries her over-the-top character with the kind of pizzazz that few other actors would've been able to pull off. Ghanchakkar stumbles similarly. It all begins with an odd, animated title sequence that in hindsight, after the film, seems like a meaningless slapdash effort. But the first half soon puts the mood in order with some hilarious sequences (a hat-tip to Point Break's bank robbery, is the funniest of the lot) and a decent plot (involving a heist, a suitcase full of cash, and memory loss) that keeps the audience guessing how it's going to end. The red herrings are handled dexterously and at every turn, just when you think Gupta's going to cheat you by revealing a new side to his characters, he keeps them true and rock steady. However, this victimizes the script and Gupta paints himself into a corner with no out and ends up botching the third act. He meanders, wastes time visualizing the obvious, and refuses to get a move on by throwing in situation after situation that only serve to widen, not propel the premise. Perhaps he could've started with more characters to play with rather than the four we're focused on, for the majority of the time based in one apartment. Sure, Gupta eventually takes the story to a place you don't expect, but is this a satisfying end? I didn't think so. Because this entire construct, this choice of subject, hinges more on the destination rather than the journey, the sense of loss is even greater. And if there's a deeper layer to this film, I'm missing it. Vidya Balan is in self-deprecating mode and hats off to her to be so in your face about it in Bollywood town. Not only is she twice Emraan Hashmi's width, she dresses up and accessorizes in the most outlandish manner. Since her character Neetu never steps out of her house, the Punjaban's "ultra-modern, fashionable" taste is sourced from a slew of fashion magazines. Her relationship with her husband Sanju is far more complex than what you usually see in Hindi movies. If there is love, there is also lack of salt at dinner; if there is understanding, there is also mistrust. Hashmi interprets his part - Sanju has to deal with more confusion than conviction - with no difficulty. He is no hero either, often getting thrashed by his live-in goons (cast and essayed well by Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das) and not retaliating. After this third film, one can only surmise that Gupta gets enthused with some terrific ideas and heads straight for the shooting floor without thinking them through entirely. Ghanchakkar is all very well as it flags off, but it's mostly downhill after it hits its high point in the first fifteen minutes.</Review>

In Raj Kumar Gupta's Ghanchakkar, the true clue to the proceedings is barely hidden. It's in the song playing in every trailer, the song over the opening credits of the film: it's fiendishly smart to say Lazy Lad and make us assume the filmmakers are talking about the protagonist when in reality they mean the screenwriter. For this is a confoundingly half-written film. Click! What is exasperating is how good it is right up to the third act, right up to the point when the people plotting this clever and twisty story decided not to type out any more ideas and let the film remain an almighty mess. Like all of Gupta's films, it starts brilliantly. Emraan Hashmi's Sanju lives with his wife Neetu (Vidya Balan) who dresses like a backup dancer in an 80s music video and doesn't have a knack for seasoning food. One evening, over a plateful of something too salted, a mysterious man calls with a very lucrative offer. Sanju, who insists they have enough saved up for a few years of idling, isn't keen but Neetu nudges him towards that classic 'one last job.' This leads to a hilarious bank robbery, one that makes dazzling use of celebrity masks that I would hate to ruin by telling you about, but it's like a Hrishikesh Mukherjee version of Point Break. Each mask wears a different expression -- a Grin, a Gasp and a Frown -- and the way these famous faces fumble their way through the chaos is priceless. The film rollickingly (and with very impressive narrative economy) zips through its constantly compelling story, and in less than a half hour we know all our principal protagonists, have seen a great robbery, and are aware that one of them has lost his memory and thus forgotten, three months later -- when the cash is meant to be divvied up -- where the loot lies. So far so far-out, and Gupta and his fine ensemble cast fill in the details with wonderful whimsy. The reliably excellent Rajesh Sharma plays an unctuous baddie called Pandit, a great contrast to his profane and trigger-happy partner, Idris (Namit Das), while Hashmi looks appropriately befuddled and Balan, from amid a deluge of polka dots, sparkles in that way only she can. I think I smiled at the screen throughout the madcap first half, the lunacy of which echoed early Coen Brothers movies. (I was particularly reminded of Raising Arizona.) Balan, in particular, deserves to be singled out for applause simply because of her willingness as a leading lady to take on a role this farcical -- that of a loud character not just overweight but mocked for her weight, through dialogue and ludicrous costume. There is a scene, I kid you not, where she wears giant earrings shaped like prisoners, as if The Beagle Boys were using her ears for clotheslines. But despite all the merry tomfoolery, a film like Ghanchakkar depends more on the meat of the story than on its execution. And somewhere through the second half, it stops being funny and becomes inane precisely at the time when it should have showed off its intelligence. We look for a big reveal and there is none. And a house of cards can't be built on jokers alone. So despite the delicious nuances -- the sabzee-buying commuter; the roadside apothecary with technicolor bottles; a chipmunk-like crook talking naughty on the phone before, without irony, straddling the film's hero -- Ghanchakkar builds up and builds up and builds up magnificently before collapsing in a bloody silly heap. I was loving this film till it turned the tables and cheated me. Maybe, like the television-addicted Sanju, we're all better off watching these films on Zee Cinema. At least we can change channels or fall asleep midway.</Review>

The fundamental concept of Ghanchakkar is intriguing all right, but it simply isn?t sturdy enough to bear the weight of an entire two hour-plus film. It presses a 1980s plot device into the service of what is meant to be a new age comic thriller and inevitably comes a cropper. Three guys pull off a bank heist, one of the robbers suffers a memory loss, and the booty goes missing. The pace of this black comedy is so somnolent that all the characters, and not just the ?lazy lad? of the film?s quirky opening song, appear to be sleepwalking through it all. What makes the film worse is that none of the handful of players is a rounded figure that the audience can relate to. This film about a man?s lost yaadasht and the complications that it sparks off seems destined to be quickly forgotten. Ghanchakkar, if it is remembered at all, will go down as an ill-advised change of pace for Raj Kumar Gupta, the maker of the memorable Aamir and No One Killed Jessica. At the heart of Ghanchakkar are a couch potato (Emraan Hashmi) who is an all but retired cat burglar and his garrulous wife (Vidya Balan) who has a fetish for strappy nightwear. The loquacious lady?s antics in the bedroom are only mildly diverting and the listless lumbering of the spaced-out man that she shares the apartment with does not help matters. The hubby, after much prodding, decides to accept the tempting offer of one final job from a duo of small-time goons. One is an avuncular and glib conspirator (Rajesh Sharma) and a jaunty young accomplice (Namit Das) given to brandishing his revolver at the slightest provocation. The trio plots the bank robbery in a midnight meeting in a compartment of a local train. At the appointed hour, the three men, wearing Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Utpal Dutt masks, raid and loot the bank. The safecracker is given the responsibility of hiding the stash of cash until the heat is off. Three months and an unspecified accident later, the male protagonist, struck by amnesia, has no remembrance of where he has kept the money. The rigmarole that ensues revolves around the hero?s struggle to recall exactly what he did that night and his two angry accomplice?s desperate attempts to get their share of the plunder. Despite its surprise ending, Ghanchakkar fails to engage. It is overstretched, flimsy and ineffectual. The screenplay (credited to Parveez Shaikh and director Raj Kumar Gupta) stutters along without much purpose. The characters are half-baked and aren?t given any context at all. Especially feckless is the figure of the hausfrau who reads Vogue and Cosmo for fashion inspiration and then goes and dons the most outlandish of outfits. Neither the husband nor the audience is inveigled. The lady is Punjabi, so she is cheerfully robust and adds a shrill haayn to the end of every sentence to convey a wide range of emotions, from bewilderment to indignation. And, needless to say, her ?minute? is ?mint?, her bharosa is bhrosa, and her galat is galt. In the ultimate analysis, she is hardly worth the salt that she wastes on her inept cooking. The two criminals who drag the couple into trouble are no better. The screenplay provides no insight into where they have come from and what they are up to. Not that anybody cares. As for the hero, he has a valid excuse for making a fool of himself. He is after all out of his mind ? and depth. Ghanchakkar tries very, very hard to raise a few laughs. You might hear a chuckle here and a giggle there, but the comic situations are far too laboured to leave a lasting impression. In a film about a man who has lost his memory, an allusion to Ghajini is inevitable. At the dinner table, where much of the film plays out, one guy declares that it is a Salman Khan film, another believes that it featured Shahrukh Khan, while a third passes it off as a Saif Ali Khan starrer. Would Aamir be amused? In another scene, the hero orders red wine on the phone. The voice at the other end of the line wants to know where the bottle has to be delivered. The poor bloke is stumped. He steps out of the door to check the number of his flat, then goes all the way down to the main gate to read the name of the housing society, and finally walks a little further to ascertain what the street is called. Funny? Hardly. Ghanchakkar is strictly for those that are easy to tickle and shock. One character, the one with the gun, sums it up best: ?I don?t know what is going on and who is taking whom for a ride.? Heed the warning!</Review>

As I drove to the preview theatre to watch Raanjhanaa, I wondered how I would spend over two hours gazing at a hero as plain as Dhanush. Until this film, I had only seen the National Award-winning actor in his blockbuster Kolaveri Di video. But my fears vanished almost as soon as the film started because in the first few minutes, Dhanush?s character Kundan jokingly acknowledges his lack of good looks. And after the first 10 minutes, I was utterly bowled over by Dhanush?s energy and charm. He?s outstanding as the spirited, street-smart son of a pundit in Benares who is a little boy when he embarks on his epic love story. The object of his passion is the local Muslim beauty, Zoya played by Sonam Kapoor. This is a love so ferocious that eventually it consumes everything in its path. But for the first half, it?s also superbly entertaining. Kundan chases Zoya with the ardour of a true devotee. She is artfully careless with his emotions but he doesn?t miss a beat. The pursuit continues for years. So much so that at one point, Kundan?s closest friend Murari, played by the terrific Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, remarks: ?Pyaar na hua, UPSC ka imtihan ho gaya. Dus saal se paas hi nahi ho raha.? The dialogues by Himanshu Sharma are the highlight of the film. The lines are pithy, earthy and wonderfully funny. Snaking his camera through the streets of Benares, director Aanand L Rai creates an intimate and lived milieu. AR Rahman?s music, especially the gorgeous Tum Tak, layers the narrative further. This love story is fantastical but these are characters we could know. Their emotions move us ? so much so that when Kundan finally breaks down and cries, I wept too. But this is where Raanjhanaa gets frustrating. Rai hits a false note as soon as the story shifts to Zoya?s romance with her college friend, Akram, played by Abhay Deol. And post-interval, when we leave Benares for New Delhi, the film derails considerably. The actors still move us ? including Sonam who looks effortlessly beautiful and gives her career?s best performance ? but the plot becomes more and more convoluted. You are neither immersed in the film nor removed from it. So, basically, I was crying without being convinced by the half-baked political twists and turns of the story. Unfortunately, Raanjhanaa never fully gets back on track. But despite these flaws, I?m recommending that you see it. Especially for Dhanush who proves that eventually looks don?t matter. Neither does size. All that towers is talent.</Review>
      <Review Id="22" Name="Rajeev Masand" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/raanjhanaa-review-it-is-not-perfect-but-it-will-do/400753-47-84.html" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="28th June,2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">A good way to measure the success of a love story is to ask yourself how much you want its protagonists to end up together. 'Raanjhanaa' is about a young Hindu boy in Benares and his unwavering love for a Muslim girl who doesn't see him as anything more than a friend. From the moment we're first introduced to them as children - him dressed as Shiva, her performing namaaz - it becomes clear there can be no love story here. Yet, Kundan (Dhanush) has been crazy about Zoya (Sonam Kapoor) ever since they were little. Convinced she'll change her mind, he pursues her relentlessly...throughout their school years, and well after she returns from Delhi on completing college, unaware that she's already in love with a boy she met on campus (Abhay Deol in a cameo). 'Tanu Weds Manu' director Anand Rai exploits the vibrancy of the holy city, and yet gives us a lived-in feel of Benares, rather than taking the typical travel-brochure approach. He banks as much on the unmistakable charm of his leading man to deliver a terrific first hour that breezes by with plenty comic moments and some genuinely heartfelt scenes. Kundan's obsessive pursuit of Zoya is nothing short of stalking. Equally disconcerting is the idea that the filmmakers would endorse slashing one's wrists as a way to profess love. Yet, truth is, these scenes don't necessarily ring untrue in the film's spot-on depiction of small-town India and its Bollywood-bred youth. The script unfortunately goes off the rails in the film's second half, when the story shifts to the JNU campus in Delhi, where our protagonists put romance on the backburner and busy themselves with active politics. Some interesting ideas, inspired by real-life current affairs, are explored here - the formation of a citizen's party, the clash between corruption and idealism, and the oppression of the rural class - but despite the filmmakers' best intentions, this track doesn't fit seamlessly into the larger narrative. If there's one reason 'Raanjhanaa' doesn't entirely disappoint in spite of its problems, it's Dhanush, who offers an uninhibited performance that's hard to take your eyes off. A National Award winning actor in Tamil cinema, Dhanush slips into the skin of Kundan and owns the part. He's complemented ably by Sonam Kapoor, who does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability. The film also benefits from two solid supporting players: Swara Bhaskar, superb as Kundan's childhood friend Bindiya, who pines for him unashamedly. And No One Killed Jessica's Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub as Kundan's best friend Murari, whose rat-a-tat lines provide some of the best laughs. For its immensely entertaining first half, a winning score by AR Rahman, but most of all for Dhanush, this is a film that's worth your time. I'm going with three out of five for Raanjhanaa. It's not perfect, but it'll do.</Review>

The Percy Sledge classic sums the spirit of Aanand L Rai?s new romance to perfection. In Raanjhanaa, a guy from Benares tests his owns limits to the extent he?ll go for the girl he?s been besotted by ever since he was a little boy. Endeavours that begin this early have a way of getting out of hand and exasperating. But Rai has Dhanush -- wonderful, tangible, indefatigable Dhanush, and the actor in his first Hindi film holds fort from start to finish. This is his story -- complicated but transparent, one that you may be inclined to feel judgemental about but one that you?ll see from his perspective. Eventually. What I liked:  After depicting a flair for blending a backdrop?s flavour in the Kanpur-themed narrative for Tanu Weds Manu, Rai extends his aptitude to introduce the verve of Varanasi in Raanjhanaa without making it too in-your-face. Moreover, since the film revolves around locals, doesn?t make sense to capture the visuals (by N Nataraja Subramanium, Vishal Sinha) like some wide-eyed tourist.  But the playful hues of Holi and a generally colourful palette that defines the city of temples fills the frames for most part till the story shifts to misty winters in Delhi?s Jawaharlal Nehru University campus. Narrated in flashback, Dhanush recalls the first time his Kundan?s kiddie version (a jovial Naman Jain. Also played Katrina Kaif?s fan in Bombay Talkies) laid eyes on THE object of his affection. But it Kundan?s pursuit of her (Sonam Kapoor in a chequered pinafore) as a ninth-grader (Dhanush), where he watches her imitating Madhuri Dixit?s popular Ek, do, teen/Channe ke khet mein steps or breaks into a spontaneous, ecstatic jig to Coolie?s Humka ishq hua hai yaaron after she slaps him more than one and a half dozen times to relent and reveal her name, Zoya, which packs in some ad lib humour. The second phase of their interactions has its moments too. There?s a charming scene where an amused Zoya (that?s Sonam) is standing on the balcony while our man dumb charades his way to refresh her memory. Contrasting personality isn?t some gimmick in Raanjhanaa. The idea is to depict a connection between two individuals developing with a different set of priorities. While one grows up, and in the process grows out, of the comfort zone to evolve, the other remains dedicated to a single-minded aspiration. Sonam and Dhanush have a peculiar chemistry. It?s neither simmering nor constrained but bears a quaint mystery, which deepens as they alternate to justify and contradict their actions. A nose-ringed Sonam looks like a dream even in regular attire of kurta, jeans, cardigan and stole. She does well in the light scenes but somewhat conscious when trying to seem vocal about serious, socio-political issues. Abhay Deol, though not relegated to a guest appearance, works as both -- the snag in the story and a charismatic ideal Raanjhanaa insists upon. Rai picks a solid actor for the role even if the payoff isn?t particularly satisfying. What I loved: Dhanush and A R Rahman. Music, here, is truly the food of love. Rahman?s understanding of the distress, intensity and anxiety of tender emotions often supersedes its director preoccupied with stuffing glamourised clips of active student politics. The latter could be handled with a lot more tautness and better presented arguments, which invite the same criticism as one of the members in the headstrong crowd  -- over simplification of complex issues, I get what Rai is trying to do -- craft a hard-hitting finale for his tale of a man?s passion and penance. If Rahman is Raanjhanaa?s discerning soul, Dhanush is its explosive heart and nimble body.  There?s a scene involving him, Deol and a gas cylinder. It?s subtle, funny and says volumes about his Kundan. Dhanush?s Hindi is wobbly but surprisingly grows on you even as his vigour burns the screen whether he?s clumsily asking out Sonam on his bike, joyously gate crashing a wedding procession or biting his lips in agony when affronted by the one he?s wronged. In reality as opposed to movies, people are changeable, making their mind, prone to think differently at different junctures, Raanjhanaa?s protagonists embody this impermanence and that?s what makes it unpredictable, startling.   What I disliked: For all its romantic zeal, Raanjhanaa treats its women rather roughly. Strangling someone in embrace, twisting arms to prove a point is not cute. Not romantic. Not done. Ironically, during a street play, Sonam brings up the issue of eve-teasing and how casually it?s treated in this country. It?s uncomfortable to watch the frequency at which the talented Swara Bhaskar (playing Kundan?s smitten, short-tempered childhood companion) is smacked by her male buddies (including an impressive Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub rattling off the punch-lines) as well as the abusive nature of their bonhomie. In one scene, she tries to seduce Kundan only to be rejected with a crude, ?Kundan ke pyjama ka naada itna bhi kamzor nahi ke tere do hook khulne se dheela ho jaaye.? Also, alarming is the regularity with which wrists are slashed. It?s ridiculous how one rebukes another as ?Jaahil/Ganwar? for making suicidal moves and two seconds later is crying hoarse about laying life if they can?t marry the one they desire. What this tells you: Raanjhanaa isn?t easy viewing. Kundan and Zoya aren?t easily likeable. They have flaws. They make mistakes. Blunders, really. But Rai shows them for what they are; he never paints a pretty picture. And this brutal honesty coupled with a commanding Dhanush is what works.</Review>

He is not saying this for a lark. Nor for a nudge-and-wink. He is saying this as if he means it. We know instantly that Raanjhanaa is a no-holds-barred love story, not your half-hearted romcom that passes for a romance these days in Bollywood. The riveting first half of the film lives up to its old- fashioned title, with a young lover whose chief driver is passion, the innocent young girl who is the object of his adoration, and the problems that keep them apart. Post interval, it comes unstuck, and squanders its gains. If Raanjhanaa had kept its tone intact, it would have been a great love story. Kundan (Dhanush), the son of a Banaras panda, is madly, deeply in love with Zoya (Kapoor). He does the running. She keeps him at bay. Just as she is about to relent, the Hindu-Muslim never-the-twain-shall-meet angle comes in, and the two part ways. I should have said 'torn asunder', actually, because that is how it is shown, him desperately chasing the train that is bearing her away, both sobbing their hearts out. When she does return, several years later, her Banarasi swain is waiting, unprepared that the girl whom he loves may love someone else (Deol). Aanand L Rai who gave us an acute, well-observed small town sensibility in his first film Tanu Weds Manu, brings the same skill sets to Raanjhanaa. It's been a while since I've seen Varanasi in the movies as a place where regular people live, not a Discovery channel shoot that peddles exotica. Rai knows the town, its people, and the lingo. Even Dhanush, whose south Indian accent is given a credible reason to exist in the film, says Banarasi launda with a flourish. The actor who really nails it, no surprise here, is Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, who plays the hero's best friend. In the second half, the film moves to Delhi, goes off to Punjab, and comes back to Delhi via Varanasi. The confusion seems to impact the characters who are left floundering. Zoya's love interest Akram is a politically active JNU lad who dreams of a better Bharat. We get a real, non-touristy Delhi and an engagement with current events ( shades of the Arvind Kejriwal-led 'people's party', the farmers' agitation in Bhatta Parsaul, the students agitation at India Gate after the December rape) that is usually missing from contemporary Bollywood. But the problem with all of this (keep an eye out for a terrific sequence which is a dig at the 'committed left-leaning JNU students' understanding of 'poverty' and 'class') is that it does not fit. The plot feels as if it is being made to function in a different film, and Raanjhanaa, by this point, is contrived and all over the place. The playfulness and intensity that Dhanush, making his Bollywood debut, exhibits consistently is what keeps the film ticking. His complete surrender to the role leads to the kind of unselfconsciousness that is so absent in Bollywood newbies who try playing lovers: if you want to show me your perfect abs, how will you let yourself screw up your face while crying for your mehbooba? And that is what makes Dhanush, who is familiar to north Indian audience only through the chartbuster Kolaveri Di, so believable. I've seen him in one Tamil film, the National-award winning Aadukalam, and there again it was visible, his becoming the part. Great casting choice, which brings back young love to Bollywood, even if it leaves me wondering: can this kind of passionate love story only be set in small towns where stalking a girl (and slitting your wrists) is still considered an acceptable plot device, as the only way of showing your feelings? Just as much Dhanush and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub feel as if they belong to the milieu, as well as Kumud Mishra (who plays Zoya's father), the others do not. Sonam Kapoor looks the part, but very often does not sound it (stumbling over such words as Bhatta Parsaul, which she has clearly pronounced for the first time, among others). She is getting better in the light-hearted bits, but her limitations as an actor are evident when she has to get serious. Swara Bhaskar, who was so good in Tanu Weds Manu, gets an over-talky but underwritten part here, and Abhay Deol sticks out, not belonging to his role at all. Raanjhanaa is a film which is all of a piece in its engaging first half, and a good Bollywood launchpad for Dhanush. Makes me want to see what he will do in his second pass.</Review>

Well, riveting might be the wrong word but the searing strides of a romance that covers decades in fast forward leaves you having to remember to breathe. It is impossible to tear your eyes off the screen as two factors work their magic: Dhanush's madly infectious enthusiasm as the young Kundan and the signature tune that plays every time his heart beats for the love of his life, Zoya. You want to grab on to these moments, pin them down so you can stare at them on your time with the same elation as Kundan's eyes have for Zoya. And you wonder if director AanandRai is going to tell his tale all so quickly - is this film going to end all too soon? The story is anything but a straightforward romance. If you're going in to watch it as a date film, check yourself. Raanjhanaa is expansive. It will start off charming you with the little details: the tenor of Benaras, the clarity of childhood love, the repercussions of the blinding optimism it effects and even in trifling recurring themes of falling cycles and slit wrists. As it progresses into the second half though, it will immerse you intellectually. Look for subtext - Rai goes well beyond a mere romance; he makes political statements, attacks communalism, gives us a slice of life insider account of youth wing statecraft; it's all there. It may not be entirely authentic and often exaggerated, but in Raanjhanaa's world, Rai strives to make it real. You may wonder why Rai chooses the path he does for where he takes the story in the second half, but the more you think about it, the less likely an alternate scenario you will find that he could've opted for to realize the ends Kundan and Zoya must reach. The excellent writing radiates to masterful direction. Rai's characters are all feisty. Every one of them. They move with purpose, even when they have none. What an incredible, refreshing reading and extension and twist to the Brahmin boy, Muslim girl Bollywood conundrum. And handled with such maturity and grace! He peppers his scenes with just the right amounts of humor, and hat tips cinema, people, and cultural idiosyncrasies. Kundan even pays a tribute to Ranjikanth catching an imaginary bullet between his teeth, while at another time the girl who's in love with him feeds bananas to a cow, seeking its blessing to realize a curse that will kill Zoya. If one must be entirely objective, then there are two critical moments in the film that opt for Bollywood-like contrivance. You'll know when you see them. But they don't take away from the experience. You can so easily tell Raanjhanaa falls into the pro-category of filmmaking. If only all of Bollywood's output was so polished. The camera work is delicious, restrained. Rai doesn't get into the trap of capturing everything - away with establishing shots! - he gets what is needed to tell the story in his frames and information that is relevant to the characters. Dhanush is so good, he makes you want to be him. Sonam hits her peak form. Abhay Deol, Kumud Mishra, Swara Bhaskar, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub are scintillating as an ensemble. Raanjhanaa flows like good poetry. It is arguably the best love story of the year so far, the kind of film others in the genre should aspire.</Review>

It has the Abhimaan angle of a famous artiste, Rahul, played by Aditya Roy Kapur, discovering a small-town girl, Aarohi, played by Shraddha Kapoor, and mentoring her to glory. But director Mohit Suri and writer Shagufta Rafique update the story. The predictable jealousy angle as the partner becomes more famous is sidelined for a thornier problem - he is an alcoholic. So, in fact, Aarohi's success becomes Rahul's salvation. For a while at least, it forces him to engage with life again. It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. The rockstar angle in Hindi movies always has touches of unintentional comedy - note Rahul's headgear, the stadiums filled with swooning fans and a hilariously slimy journalist in the second half who pushes Rahul to the brink again - but despite this, Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as the woman in the throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way. The problem is that once we are invested in these people, Suri doesn't take the story much further. It becomes overwrought, repetitive and, ultimately, boring. Addictions in themselves don't make for compelling cinema - after a while, Rahul consuming copious amounts of alcohol, trashing rooms and getting into brawls becomes just tedious. Suri tries hard to raise the old-school melodrama to high tragedy but the screenplay is just too clumsy and pedestrian. Like the original, Aashiqui 2 has melodious music - the song Tum hi ho, composed by Mithoon, has a lovely sweep and ache. The film, however, never becomes more than the sum of its parts. Aashiqui 2 falls into that lukewarm category of 'I didn't mind it,' which is not the same as 'I liked it.' It could have been so much more.</Review>
      <Review Id="27" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="ThumbsDown" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/movie-review-aashiqui-2-has-similarities-with-the-first/1107999/" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="30th APril,2013" Likes="58" Rating="2/5">More than 20 years ago, the Bhatts crafted a blockbuster out of a string of songs sung by fresh voices. And a pair of new faces, artfully hidden under a jacket, for the purposes of a poster. The songs came first, the movie came after. Aashiqui's soundtrack became all the rage. So did that instantly-recognisable image of young-lovers-under-jacket. Now comes the sequel. Aashiqui number 2 has similarities with the first: the Bhatts are co-producers along with Bhushan Kumar (son of the slain T series magnate Gulshan, who was responsible for the phenomenal success of the original's music, still bouncing about in playlists). Music leads from the front again. But this time around, it is not as distinctive, and that's because the Bhatts may have become victims of their own created template of sufi-soft-pop-cum-rock. No single song of the new Aashiqui leaps out at you. And this, along with a story that starts with some lift and then dips makes the new film a messy meander. Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a singer fighting his demons, with the help of good pal (Shaad Randhawa). Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha Kapoor) is a girl who worships Lata Mangeshkar and wants to be a singer. For reasons that are never explained, Rahul's constant companion is alcohol. Lots of it. But he is not so soused that he can't spot talent: he hears Aarohi sing in a shady Goa bar, and knows she is the next best thing. And then comes the Abhimaan-like arc, as the two deal with obscurity, fame and heartbreak, and it all becomes mothballed. Mohit Suri knows how to get lovers to start off the blocks. And the best part of this film is these two trying out each other for size, despite an embarrassing meet-cute. Roy Kapoor shows he has mettle: I was wondering about that after his turns in Action Replayy and Guzaarish, bad films both, but his potential is clear in this one. Kapoor also does a tad better than her earlier outings, but is patchy. The lead couple has a moment or two, but doesn't spark overall. The more I see these so-called love stories with promising beginnings and then wandering about, not knowing what to do with themselves, the more I wonder whether present day Bollywood has any idea of making real romances any more. Suri has directorial skill ( some of his sequences in 'Woh Lamhe' are still on recall), but where are the people writing good stuff ? Once the lovers come together, and the first act is over, why does everything slide? This Aashiqui 2 holds out promise, but doesn't make the most of it.</Review>

An innocent resolve to guide that snowballs into a torrid affair. Love. Addiction. Tears. Karma. Sacrifice. Music. Music, above all else. This, in a nutshell, is Aashiqui 2: freshly crated off the Bhatt assembly line. However, this time they've jilted the idea of shocking, scaring, or scarring you and opted for convention with conviction. The result: a mashup that pays tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Abhimaan and Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar. Though engaging and mature for most part, the screenplay of Aashiqui 2 stubbornly refuses to break the surface tension of the cyclic story. And, unfortunately it is neither deep nor very original, functioning more as tribute. There's hardly an emotion you haven't been manipulated into before, oldfashioned misunderstandings out of sync with the tech at hand, or a scene that doesn't feel like instant deja vu. It's reference points managed to surmount these: Abhimaan was a story Hindi film audiences hadn't seen before. And just the very scale of Rockstar coupled with Ranbir Kapoor's antics made the film cult-like. Still Aashiqui 2 does have its fair share of tender moments framed by copious amounts of tears. I liked that the relationship is purely platonic almost until the half way mark and when feelings can't be contained any more, they gush out like an unrestrained hurricane. And yet the scene that paints this picture is poignant, and gives you the one image you're likely to be left with long after you're done the movie. She hesitates, nervous about her first shot at professional singing, refusing to enter the recording studio. He tries to coax her in. They have a heart-to-heart conversation through a glass slat in the door. There's perfection even in the sound design. Love makes for an unseemly mixer for the all the alcohol he drinks. He must choose. He can't choose. Just as his weakness is the bottle, hers his him. She makes a choice. Him, with his baggage. He promises to clean up. He falters. Rinse. Repeat. Until you reach the end of the vortex. You don't move ahead much. Mostly down. The focus stays on the leads. Literally. Many one-scene characters are never seen, only the reactions of him or her. Mohit Suri has options galore for his climax. He chooses the most difficult and most correct end. It's a pity that a few weak moments of stupidity preempt in sacrifice for quality drama. That and the fact that they seem to be living on separate continents while the makers pass it off as one city. Pepper the scenes with some poor dialogue and what should've be a satisfying, sentimental date film turns out less than what you'd have hoped for. Invest, instead, in the actors. Finally, Aditya Roy Kapoor and young Shraddha Kapoor get roles with some leeway to make it their own. And Aashiqui 2 is their coming of age. Mohit Suri is a director who knows his craft and he continues to make cinema with certitude and heart. Aashiqui 2's delicate handling certainly feels more than mere execution of a script. It's just that his audience needs to be in a similar space of mind to truly enjoy this film. Sure it has its music and moments, but it doesn't really say anything new.</Review>
      <Review Id="29" Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Expected="ThumbsUp***" Link="" Affiliation="India Today" Date="26th April,2013" Likes="573" Rating="2.5/5">Aashiqui set quite a few trends. It ushered the new-age musical on release in 1990. The soundtrack emerged as a hero, setting a template that let producers make profits casting unknown names as leads. In turn composer duo Nadeem-Shravan emerged as superstars, dictating productions because scripts started being written to fit their songs. Their music, largely blending traditional geet and ghazal with a hint of vintage RD Burman, brought back melody after the boisterous eighties. It is essential to understand the Aashiqui phenomenon to fathom what the Bhatts were up to this time. Aashiqui 2 is in no way about setting trends. The film merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along. Mohit Suri as director should have been an advantage. Mohit has proved his mettle as a storyteller with hardhitting drama such as Zeher, Kalyug, Raaz 2 and Murder 2. In Aashiqui 2 he tries mixing that idiom with smoother strains of mush. Yet, you spot sheer lack of energy about Mohit???s treatment this time though the overall packaging is impressively GenNow. It seems the film stretches a script worth an hour to its full runtime only because it wanted to accommodate all the songs. Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor get their big breaks playing the romantic duo. Aditya is cast as Rahul Jaykar, wasted rockstar battling alcoholism. He spots the incredibly talented Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha) crooning at a bar and decides to mentor her. The narrative unfolds their blossoming romance and a couple of soothing numbers unfolds. You don???t miss strains of Hrishikesh Mukherjee???s 1973 hit Abhimaan (starring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri) in the drama that follows. Aarohi???s stardom escalates and so does Rahul???s envy. Ego comes in the way of their love. Shagufta Rafique???s story avoids taking risks. Bhatt flicks have always been typified by a flawed hero fighting inner angst. Aashiqui 2 lets Aditya???s Rahul play to the gallery with that bit. If the budding actor struggles to get the nuances right, it is mainly because he gets a weak character to play out. Aditya???s chemistry with Shraddha also suffers for the same reason. She looks pretty, as all Bollywood love stories require the heroine to, but she fails to add some spark. Finally the music, the film???s real winner. A battery of three composers (Mithoon, Jeet Ganguly, Ankit Tiwari) give the film its big reason to cheer for. Also, lend a ear to newbie singer Arijit Singh. Here???s hoping Aashiqui 2 does for Arijit what the first film did for Kumar Sanu all those years ago.</Review>

The girl possesses a voice to kill for. The boy has a fan following to die for. The twosome sings for a living. The temperamental, hard-drinking male protagonist is a major composer and songwriter with many a chartbuster under his belt and a humongous chip on his shoulders. The girl ? she is poor, ambitious and down to earth ? struggles to make ends meet. She sings in seedy beer bars. The boy, smitten by the girl?s soulful singing of a song that he made a name with, goes out of his way to help her find a firmer foothold in the business and get ahead in life. And when there is so much music wafting in the air, can Cupid's arrow be far behind? It finds its mark soon enough and the duo is soon exchanging sweet nothings. But before the boy, Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapoor), knows it, he has been upstaged by the girl, Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha Kapoor). Her stocks zoom; he hits the skids. The more she sings the deeper he sinks. Yes, you?ve guessed it, tension and heartburn erupt between the two. And the drama takes on a shrill edge. Aashiqui 2, directed by Mohit Suri, isn?t a retelling of merely the 1990 hit with which Mahesh Bhatt made instant but transitory stars out of Rahul Roy and Anu Agarwal. This story has been on the silver screen times without number ever since David O Selznick produced A Star is Born three quarters of a century ago. In Mumbai, most memorably, it took the form of Hrishikesh Mukherjee?s Amitabh Bachchan-Jaya Bhaduri 1973 starrer Abhimaan. Does Aashiqui 2 have anything new to offer? Nothing at all. It is a musical love story with a feel so old-world that it reeks of staleness. There is little in the latest incarnation of A Star is Born that could be held up by its producers as a pressing enough explanation for why this musical love story, which one thought was a deal that had been done and dusted for good, had to be made all over again. Even the lead actors aren't newcomers, so do not expect them to inject any freshness into the proceedings. Aashiqui 2 is actually an attempt to relaunch the careers of Aditya Roy Kapoor (London Dreams, Action Replayy, Guzaarish) and Shraddha Kapoor (Luv Ka The End, Teen Patti). It does not seem likely yield the desired result. The lead pair is at best passable. Neither of the two is a finished article yet. They give their roles their all, but the impact of their labour falls way short of the intended target. If that isn't bad enough, the film is also weighed down by clich?-ridden screenplay. It leaves too much to Aditya and Shraddha and neither has the wherewithal yet to be able to cover up for what the script lacks. Aashiqui 2 is riddled with syrupy inanities that add up to insubstantial treacle. No amount of surface gloss can salvage it. The film is obviously meant for a youth audience, which is probably not the easiest segment to inveigle. Aditya Roy Kapoor, in his first full-fledged lead role, exudes the kind of confidence that borders on airiness. He is fine in the lighter moments, but when the drama turns intense, the chinks begin to show. There are situations in the plot that simply aren?t convincing enough, and the young actor can do little to extract something of significance out of them. Shraddha Kapoor, too, shows promise, but only in flashes. On the evidence available in Aashiqui, she has the makings of a star with some staying power provided she learns to stay within her limitations. A musical love story works best when both the songs and the romance border on the inspired. 1990?s Aashiqui, despite its box office success, wasn?t such a great film. What has ensured immortality for it was its music album, which still ranks among the most popular ever produced in Mumbai. In Aashiqui 2, some of the songs are definitely hummable, but the musical score as a whole is patchy. And the love story in which they are embedded lacks the requisite solidity. So neither film nor the music ever rises above the very, very ordinary. Fluffy and flaky, Aashiqui 2 is simply not peppy enough to paper over its cracks.</Review>

Nikhil Advani's 'D-Day' is the latest, a promising action thriller constructed around the long-cherished dream of capturing Dawood, the principal accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. The role of Dawood himself, referred to in this film as Iqbal Seth, and nicknamed Goldman, is played creepily by Rishi Kapoor sporting a moustache and rose-tinted shades. We first see him in the film's terrific opening sequence, arriving for a wedding celebration at a Karachi hotel, where, despite heavy security, an audacious plan to nab him is underway. The film's crisp first-half, much of it unfolding in flashback, sets up the drama nicely. The chief of India's Research &amp; Analysis Wing (or R&amp;AW) has put Operation Goldman into motion, following another blast in India masterminded by the terror monger who is staked out in Pakistan. A covert team of undercover agents Wali (Irrfan Khan), Rudra (Arjun Rampal), Zoya (Huma Qureshi), and Aslam (Akash Dahiya) have been tasked with ferreting out Iqbal as he gets ready to attend his son's wedding. Meshing fact with fiction, often sacrificing logic for thrills, the briskly paced script (co-written by Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, and Advani) slows down routinely to show us the agents in their downtime with family and lovers, even as they flesh out their grand plan collectively. Rudra takes up with a melancholic prostitute (Shruti Haasan) in a red-light district, while Wali is deeply committed to his young son and wife (played with aching vulnerability by Sreeswara). 'D-Day', with all its gritty action, hand-held camerawork and frenetic editing, is still closer in spirit and tone to 'Ek Tha Tiger' and 'Agent Vinod' than 'Zero Dark Thirty'. The film can't escape typical jingoistic traps, and doesn't think twice of forsaking realism for filmi heroism. So our undercover heroes get into a public scrap with an ISI agent in broad daylight, and in one spectacularly silly scene, Rudra follows a man who had disfigured his lover's face and stabs him brutally to death in a garage, evidently unconcerned about raising suspicions. But if you're willing to sidestep niggling problems like the rapidly rising body count they leave in their wake, and the apparent ease with which our heroes secure ammo in Pakistan, you'll note the film's second half raises some interesting points, including the very real conundrum of secret agents who're abandoned by their governments in hostile lands after failed operations. There's also one remarkably filmed song in which Advani takes one of our protagonists through a bloody massacre of a loved one, as if it were happening before his very eyes. It's portions like these that elevate the film from the ordinary, and much credit must also go to its committed cast. No praise is enough for the chameleon-like Rishi Kapoor, who adapts himself to the film's two very different tones, and offers a performance that is menacing and hammy in all the right places. The talented Huma Qureshi is under-utilised here, but plays her part competently. A quick mention also of Chandan Roy Sanyal who is deliciously sadistic as Iqbal's nephew and right-hand man. But the film is a showcase for its two male leads. Irrfan Khan excellently conveys the quiet desperation of a man torn between family and mission, and Arjun Rampal does some of his best work here as the rebellious agent simmering with pent up anger. 'D-Day' is far from perfect, but as pulpy Bollywood action films go, it's very watchable and works its strengths. The film's ending, controversial and melodramatic to say the least, nevertheless sits comfortably with the wish-fulfilment fantasy that Advani's milking. I'm going with three out of five. It's worth a watch; you won't be bored.</Review>

For director Nikhil Advani, that was half the battle won. Advani, who has desperately tried exorcising the demons of Salaam-e-Ishq and Chandni Chowk To China for a while now, discards masala basics to go for the high octane with his latest. The film tries balancing gritty realism with what sells. Also, the fact that D-Day has no big stars has been cloaked with sufficient melodrama and some good action. The overall package works for a one-time watch. D-Day could have been much more if Advani was more assured as a storyteller. Despite a plum cast, the narrative tends to become convoluted at times. A highlight in the promos has been Rishi Kapoor's latest villain avatar. He plays Karachi-based don/businessman Iqbal, alias Goldman, but his thick moustache, trademark shades and wig betray a Bollywoodised Dawood Ibrahim. The veteran has been on a killer spree of evil lately, triggered off by Agneepath and carried forward with aplomb in Aurangzeb. D-Day completes a nice set of three in villainy for the actor. But if Goldman isn't a patch on Agneepath's ruthless pimp Rauf Lala, Rishi Kapoor can't be blamed. We have seen too many of these Dawood-type rehashes now in Bollywood for the prototype to remain novel. The actor however scores by delivering the sinister with an understated edge and flamboyance. Irrfan is cast as Wali Khan, RAW agent in Karachi to trace Goldman's movement. The don lives in a high-security set-up monitored by ISI. Wali finds a possible chink in the armour when he learns Goldman will break ISI security protocol to come out for his son's wedding. A team is put in place. Armyman Rudra Pratap Singh (Arjun Rampal), RAW explosives expert Zoya Rehman (Huma Qureshi) and Aslam (Akash Dhaiya), a petty thief employed by RAW, have to bring back the terrorist to India. To max out the drama, each has a personal score to settle beyond the line of duty. Of course, there is a twist. It takes the film to a credible climax. But you realise that in parts the film's tendency to be violent could merely be a ploy to extend runtime. A talented cast comes up with functional performances. Irrfan, Arjun and Huma get some cool action that they clearly enjoy essaying. Shruti Haasan, introduced in the script as a Pakistani sex worker, does well to balance titillation with a tragic subplot. And watching Rishi Kapoor hit the menace mode, you only wish the eighties chocolate boy takes to shades of grey more often. D-Day is quick and sleek. It is your film if violence mixed with melodrama and pop patriotism is your cocktail of choice.</Review>

The backdrop is established for the world's most wanted man Iqbal (Rishi Kapoor) who will be present there for it's his son's wedding. There's ample commotion with a surge of people out to capture the gangster. Cut to parking lot of the hotel where the wedding is happening, Rudra (Arjun Rampal) has Iqbal at gun point but Wali Khan (Irrfan Khan) doesn't want him to shoot. What follows is a loud gun-shot, a bomb blast and a black out. Is Iqbal shot? Who are those four people? Watch the film to find out. Known for exaggerated melodramatic family sagas or romantic fairs like Kal Ho Na Ho or Salaam-E-Ishq, filmmaker Nikhil Advani marks a major shift in his filmmaking as he makes this taut espionage thriller D-Day. The film is about four RAW Agents Rudra, Wali, Aslam (Aakash Dahiya) and Zoya (Huma Qureshi) who are set out on a mission by RAW director Ashwini Rao (Nasser) to capture the most wanted man and bring him back to India. But each of them have their own personal baggage to tackle with as well, while Wali gets a wife and a kid whom he adores during his undercover stint in Pakistan, Zoya leaves behind her fiance for this mission. Nikhil Advani attempts a tight and gripping story about undercover agents pretty much like Hollywood's Zero Dark Thirty. However, it's the stress on the emotional angle of every character that gets in the way making the film appear prolonged. But that doesn't take away the fact that he still gets a startling drama which will make you sit at the edge of your seat for most parts. It's the story-telling technique of Nikhil in the first half that deserves to be applauded. He proceeds to the crime scene within the initial 15 minutes and rewinds the incident giving it an edgy and pacey build up. His strength also lies in his casting. Right from having Rishi Kapoor for a fashionably loud, and volatile Iqbal Seth who breathes life into his character to Irrfan Khan who can literally sleep walk into any character under the sun, every character is impactful. Arjun Rampal has excelled himself by leaps and bound and makes a commendable effort of an ex-army man turned RAW Agent delightfully. South actor Nasser fits the bill perfectly and brings the much needed weight to his character. Chandan Roy Sanyal as Iqbal's bhanja (nephew) is extremely impressive. There are certain scenes in the film which are exceptionally shot and demand a round of applause. Especially the song sequence over the crime scene of Shruti Haasan who plays a prostitute from Pakistan sheltering Rudra. The cinematography work throughout the film is brilliant as it convincingly establishes the coarse background of Karachi, the gangster stables etc. Had it not been for a jingoistic speech towards the end and the highly melodramatic familial sagas of each and every character along with predictable turn of events, D-Day could have been a flawless nail-biting thriller which it was throughout the first half. But despite its flaws, the movie still deserves a watch.</Review>

The plot crackles. The acting sears. And the music flares with passion. Four Indian agents, angry and RAW, enter Pakistan to bring Iqbal Seth (Rishi Kapoor), a Dawood-like don, hated for his terrorism, home. Wali Khan (Irrfan) has married a local woman and fathered a child, but longs to find freedom from the truth and lies he lives. Irrfan amazes, switching from tender to treacherous in a flash, authentic as he calls out "Rudar!" to Rudra Pratap Singh (Arjun), a man of molten mysteries, introduced with a Lawrence of Arabia-like flair. Arjun looks smashing and pulls off a competent act while Zoya (Huma) does well as a cutie-pie who can squeeze a knife real bad. Aslam (Aakash Dahiya), a gangster-turned-agent, forms the fourth wheel, but Rishi Kapoor stands out as Iqbal Seth, with his polyester-like silky malevolence, his mocking manipulations, his eyes behind red goggles, both frightened and frightening. That mirrors the plot which flips rapidly, hunters becoming the hunted, then vice-versa. Nasser, as RAW director Ashwini Rao, is convincing as an official straining at the leash while Iqbal's bhanja (Chandan Sanyal) is splendid with his simply asinine evil. A beautifully fragile Shruti Haasan plays a prostitute sheltering Rudra. Their track is short but sensual, a little lily-pool of beauty in an otherwise relentlessly harsh cinematography, where Karachi's grey, gritty and gunpowder-laced. But this being Bollywood, the plot can't escape emotional excursions. Some - Rudra's love-life, Zoya's break-up - adds a halwa-like heaviness to this Karachi. But the second half refreshes your palate, sizzling sequences between Wali, Rudra and Iqbal Seth leaving you open-mouthed, the 'c' in this climax clearly for controversy. Catch it - this 'D' company denotes both debate and desh-prem.</Review>

A variety of movies and assorted stories are being attempted week after week. With a novel tale unfolding every week, a Hindi movie buff has a lot to look forward to. Who would've ever anticipated that the maker of poignant and stirring films like KAL HO NAA HO, SALAAM-E-ISHQ and PATIALA HOUSE -- underlining a strong emotional undercurrent in each of those films -- would attempt a film about India's Most Wanted Man? Not me, for sure! But Nikhil Advani ventures into an alien terrain with D-DAY, which, on surface, may seem like yet another gangster film, but it's not. There have been a lot of debates about gangsters who have sought a secure haven on foreign soil and a lot is being said about getting them back to India for trial and justice. But D-DAY is the first Hindi film to explore this pertinent aspect [read burning issue]. The plotline of D-DAY conjures up memories of the 2012 film ZERO DARK THIRTY, which was about the manhunt for the world's most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden. However, the similarities between the two films end there. What makes D-DAY relevant and relatable is the fact that Nikhil borrows from real-life headlines/occurrences and gives it a new spin altogether, interpreting the story his way. The basic premise of the film -- RAW agents being assigned the task of bringing back the fugitive crime lord back to India -- evokes tremendous curiosity, but at the same time, Nikhil knows that since the subject matter is sensitive and volatile, it ought to be tackled with extreme concern and caution. Thankfully, Nikhil treats this explosive theme with extreme care. Nine years ago, Wali Khan [Irrfan] was sent to Karachi, Pakistan by the Chief of RAW Ashwini Rao [Nasser] to report the activities of the Most Wanted Man in India. Nine days ago, Rudra Pratap Singh [Arjun Rampal], Indian Armed Forces, Zoya Rehman [Huma Qureshi], RAW Explosives Expert and Aslam [Aakash Daahiya], a petty thief from the streets of Mumbai, recruited by RAW, join Wali in Pakistan to carry out the mission to bring back the Most Wanted Man in India. The man who was going to break all ISI protocol and security and attend his own son's wedding. The man who could, on that day, be abducted and brought back to India to face justice. The team sent in to bring the Most Wanted Man in India did the unthinkable -- they carried out the most daring operation and almost got away with it. Almost, because something went horribly wrong! There have been umpteen debates and discussions to extradite gangsters and criminals operating from foreign land and Nikhil, together with writers Ritesh Shah and Suresh Nair, weaves a yarn that's part bona fide, part fiction. D-DAY is gritty and hard-hitting, but most importantly, it's an earnest attempt. The setting appears authentic [D-DAY gives the impression of being filmed in Pakistan], the sequence of events is well connected and the implementation of the written material is compelling. Not once do you feel that Nikhil bites off more than he can chew. D-DAY tackles a knotty issue and it's imperative that Nikhil stays close to authenticity. The demanding plot and the edgy, gritty and raw situations, besides the ambience [recreating Karachi], makes this espionage thriller so different from the gangster films we have witnessed on the Hindi screen thus far. The four patriots, each with a back story, joining hands for a common mission, their expedition and how the hunters become the hunted in the neighbouring country gives the film that edge and power that's hard to expunge from memory. Nikhil reserves the best for the finale. The fight at the border and what ensues blows your mind and can easily be termed as the icing on the cake. Sure, Nikhil and his writers run their imagination wild here, but let me tell you, this finale is sure to meet with wild cheers. The sole hiccup is that the film appears elongated and could've been short and snappy by 10/15 odd minutes. A succinctly narrated theme only aids in augmenting the overall impact, as we know by now. Nikhil keeps the action [Tom Struthers] as real as possible. Besides, the action in D-DAY is not the type that is dominating the Hindi screen of late. It's raw, but believable, keeping in mind the characters the protagonists illustrate. The soundtrack [Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy] is absolutely in sync with the mood of the film. The best track of the film is, without doubt, 'Alvida'. The visuals in the song are mind-blowing. Tushar Kanti Ray's cinematography captures the gritty ambience to perfection. Dialogue [Ritesh Shah and Niranjan Iyengar] are strong and compelling. D-DAY has an ensemble cast, but the scene stealer is, without doubt, Rishi Kapoor. The veteran continues to push boundaries, challenging himself and astonishing the spectators. Recall the man coping with inflation in DO DOONI CHAAR, the stern family patriarch in PATIALA HOUSE, the villainous character in AGNEEPATH, the college dean in STUDENT OF THE YEAR and the ageing romantic in CHASHME BADDOOR. D-DAY proves his versatility yet again as he gets to portray the much-feared don. He's tremendous! Irrfan has always proved himself, irrespective of how good/bad the film may be, and it's no different this time. Of course, the accomplished actor gets a power-packed character and he leaves a stunning impact yet again. The film proves, yet again, his brilliance as an artiste of calibre in several sequences, especially the ones towards the closing stages of the film. Arjun Rampal continues to surprise and evolve as an actor. It seems, he is on an experimenting mood and the character he portrays in D-DAY gives him the opportunity to step forward as an actor. He's top notch! Huma Qureshi too gets ample opportunity to get into a diverse zone with this film and she seizes the prospect instantaneously. She stands on her own, despite the presence of formidable and much-experienced actors in the frame. Shruti Haasan gets a complicated, layered character and she handles it with gusto. The chemistry with Arjun is electrifying as well. Sriswara, portraying the character of Irrfan's wife, is a revelation. She will make heads turn with her talent. Aakash Daahiya is competent. Although the film stars far more experienced names, he grabs you attention every time he appears on screen. Nasser [as RAW chief], K.K. Raina [as Gen. Raza], Chandan Roy Sanyal [as Bhanja], Imran Hasnee [as Saleem Pathan], Nissar Khan [as Niyaaz Ahmed] and Sandeep Kulkarni [as Atul Mishra] -- each of them contribute so much to every sequence. Divij Handa, as Irrfan's kid Kabir, is super. Rajpal Yadav's presence enlivens the song at the very start. On the whole, D-DAY is what a well-made thriller ought to be -- taut, transfixing and spellbinding, with an astounding finale. Don't miss this high-octane thriller!</Review>

      <Review Id="36" Name="Mayank Shekhar" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/3-idiots-464" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="24th Dec,2009" Likes="0" Rating="2/5">By now, I guess the word of mouth is already out. It shouldn't be news to anyone that 3 Idiots surely deserves three cheers, and more. But the first thing you realise about this film is not that a 44-year-old Aamir Khan can play a 22-year-old college kid, and he can get away with it. Well, he does. What you realise actually, as director Raju Hirani does, is that to make a very urgent point, one doesn't need to preach and get all self-serious. A lot can be said purely through songs and suspensions of disbelief. And a wonderful genre called comedy. The film is actually a fairly serious take on a cruel examination system that gets passed off for an education system in this country. We produce IIT graduates who take up high-paying jobs. We don't make original thinkers who could pick up a Nobel prize for an invention. Aamir's Rancho is actually one such natural genius. He obviously can't fit into an Indian classroom, where all you have to do is mug up, to rise up. He plays the fool. But he still tops the tests. His two friends remain flunkeys throughout. And that is because, one of them, is burdened by his family's expectations and a fear of exams. The other is passionate about wildlife photography, and not physics. In India, even now, you should either be in engineering or medicine. It's usually the parents' promissory note. It's also a suicide note for many. The hilarious skits between the three friends and their dull, dreaded professor here, Virus, played by Boman Irani, reveal a non-stop Munnabhai comedy with a similar purpose. Rancho takes on Virus and the system. Virus takes on Rancho, and his friends. And one day, Rancho completely disappears. Many years later, his friends go out in search of who he was. As Raju Hirani says, this film is about five per cent of Chetan Bhagat's bestseller Five Point Someone. This is in fact a hardcore Bollywood flick, which demands its own share of subjectivity while you watch many parts of the story fit very conveniently into the larger scheme. The filmmakers know just when to throw in that emotional low, after a comical high. They know when the song is most appropriate. And when melodrama will do just fine. Very few contemporary Bollywood directors understand this now. The fact that you don't feel like the fourth idiot watching 3 Idiots is, for its genre, the greatest relief. This is in every way Munnabhai - part 3. I think you shouldn't miss it at all.</Review>
      <Review Id="37" Name="Rajeev Masand" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-movie-review-3-idiots-satisfying-not-best/107739-8.html" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="28th Dec,2009" Likes="" Rating="3/5">Going home after watching 3 Idiots I felt like I'd just been to my favorite restaurant only to be a tad under-whelmed by their signature dish. It was a satisfying meal, don't get me wrong, but not the best meal I'd been expecting. 3 Idiots, starring Aamir Khan, produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, is a film of impeccable pedigree. It's a breezy entertainer and it's got its heart in the right place, but it appears to be lacking in the naiive idealism and old-fashioned sincerity that propelled Hirani's two Munnabhai films to cult status. Loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's pulpy bestseller Five Point Someone, 3 Idiots takes light-hearted but pointed jabs at the Indian education system, raising pertinent questions about the relevance of learning by rote, the obsession with high grades, and the dangerous repercussions of parental pressure to pursue traditional streams. Set on an engineering campus in Delhi modeled after the IIT, the film features Aamir Khan as free-spirited student Rancho who dishes out important life lessons to his roommates Farhan and Raju (played by R Madhavan and Sharman Joshi), even as Naziesque campus director Viru Sahastrabuddhe (played by Boman Irani) clashes with him for brazenly rejecting conventional wisdom. Rancho, as it turns out, can do just about anything. From empowering Farhan to convince his family he wants to be a photographer not an engineer, to nursing another friend back to health after a failed suicide attempt, Rancho even helps an unsuspecting girl open her eyes to the superficial jerk she's about to marry, and believe it or not, at one point he even delivers a baby on the college ping-pong table following instructions from a doctor on webcam. But soon after teaching them these valuable lessons and touching their lives in some way or the other, Rancho vanishes. The film is told mostly in flashback, with Farhan and Raju setting off to find their buddy a few years later. And because no Hindi film can be complete without a romance, Hirani and his co-writer Abhijat Joshi also manage to squeeze in a love track between Rancho and the college director's daughter Pia (played by Kareena Kapoor). The film's first half breezes by effortlessly between Hirani's trademark comic flourishes including a hilarious ragging scene, two witty confrontations with teachers, and even an uproarious Farrelly Brothers-style gag involving a rolling pin and a paralysed man. Expectedly, the humor is alternated with moments of poignancy like that delicate scene in which the group first discovers a fellow student's suicide. Problem is, the genuine lump-in-your-throat moments are few and far between, the screenplay populated instead by a batch of scenes calling for push-button emotions. Where the Munnabhai films cunningly tricked you into shedding an unexpected tear, 3 Idiots goes for full-throttle melodrama. The film's second half in particular, is a tiring mess of ridiculous back-stories, convenient coincidences and sappy sentimentality. Despite these hiccups, the film still works to a fair extent because of the inherent optimism in the plot and the sheer good-naturedness of its characters. It's hard to resist Rancho's cheery "All izz well" chant even if Hirani does push it a little too far when he ties it to a baby's first in-womb kick, and the scene I mentioned earlier involving a delivery on a ping-pong table. Of the cast, Sharman Joshi has a meatier role than R Madhavan, hence succeeds in fleshing him out more competently. Kareena Kapoor makes her presence felt despite the small role, and Boman Irani - although he's trapped in a caricature - inspires hearty laughs. But for me, the performance that stood out in this film belongs to lesser-known LA-based actor Omi Vaidya who stars as the Hindi-challenged Chatur Ramalingam, who deserves credit for turning an old childish gag into what is one of the film's funniest scenes on the strength of his pitch-perfect expressions and delivery. And then of course, there's Aamir Khan as Rancho. Who never quite passes off as a 20-something-year-old, but remains the heart and soul of 3 Idiots with his spot-on comedy, his measured histrionics, and his immense likeability. The film, in the end, is a broad entertainer that plays to the gallery, well-intentioned but sadly muddled. However it's warmer than any other comedy this year - think Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, All The Best or De Dana Dan - and hence it's unquestionably an enjoyable watch. From the man behind those decade-defining Munnabhai films, however, it is far from his best work. I'm going with three out of five for director Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, an earnest but calculated effort that runs, but never flies. Watch it anyway, because it's the season to be jolly, and good laughs are guaranteed.</Review>
      <Review Id="38" Name="Aniruddha Guha" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/1327142/review-3-idiots-is-cinema-at-its-best" Affiliation="DNA" Date="24th Dec,2013" Likes="" Rating="4/5">Rajkumar Hirani is the best filmmaker Hindi cinema has produced in a long, long time. It's not that there aren't other mavericks, geniuses, and talented storytellers who give us some fabulous movies from time to time. But Hirani has, one film after the other, proved his mettle as a writer/director who does not believe in giving you entertainment the easy way ? he ensures that you take back home a few lessons about life, too. Three Idiots has one of the most relevant issues of Indian society at its core, a heartwarming story woven around it and a narrative that takes you through the film effortlessly, leaving you happy, moved, and thoughtful in the end. Yes, the film has certain hard-to-digest moments ? like engineering students helping a woman to deliver a child in the campus with the help of some 'skills' ? but if the oft misused term 'cinematic liberty' has ever been put to apt use, it is here. Ranchhoddas Chhanchad aka Rancho (Khan), Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan), and Raju Rastogi (Joshi) have got admission in ICE, the most prestigious engineering college in India. "You'll have to beat your competitor every step of the way if you want to be successful in life," dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe aka Virus (Irani) tells students on their first day in college. While the others just follow orders, Rancho defies rules. He raises questions in class his teachers can't answer, refuses to complete assignments unless he really enjoys them, and infuriates the dean, who is a stickler for perfection. "You have the best college in the country, yet none of your students has ever invented anything of note," Rancho tells the dean straight-faced, enraging him further. To make matters worse, he falls in love with the dean's daughter (Kapoor). The dean is out to make Rancho's life hell but is baffled how Rancho deceives him every time. The most laidback of all students, he surprises everyone by ending at the top of the class, year after year, confounding even his two friends. "We learnt an important lesson," says Farhan. "When your friend fails an examination, you feel bad. But when he tops it, you feel worse." Rancho explains to his friends that the only reason he excels at everything he does is because he enjoys doing them. He coerces the two to follow their goals without worrying about the end result, and by the end of the four-year period, the two feel more confident of what they want to do in life than before they entered college and met Rancho. While the institute asked them to chase success, Rancho asked them to chase excellence, assuring them that success would follow. But soon after teaching them life's most valuable lesson, Rancho disappears. Why does Rancho leave without telling anyone of his whereabouts? Where does he go? The film starts with Farhan and Raju renewing their search for Rancho after five years, following a lead they get on his whereabouts from one of their closest competitors in college, Chatur. The movie then moves into flashback mode, returning to real time every now and then. Starting with the first scene, the screenplay moves in one fluid motion, interweaving scenes and sequences one after the other in brilliant, seamless fashion. Writers Hirani and Abhijat Joshi (story, screenplay, and dialogues) and Vidhu Vinod Chopra (screenplay associate) have worked painstakingly on every sequence, each of which stands out for its brilliance. There are so many 'highlights' and scenes that impress you that pointing out a few would be unfair to the others. Three Idiots is, in every way, a complete film ? one that works in its entirety, be it storytelling, dialogues, acting, music, cinematography, art direction, editing, etc. At the helm of it all is the captain of the ship ? director Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan puts in a restrained performance and brings both the maturity and confusion that his character requires. Joshi is good. His character undergoes immense change in the film and the actor brings across those subtle differences beautifully. Kapoor, in a smaller role, does a good job. Irani's performance ranges from competent to caricaturish, but works with the mood of the film. Omi as Chatur aka Silencer gets ample screen space and performs well as the grades-hungry student everyone hates in class. Shantanu Moitra's music blends into the film perfectly and the songs are extremely hummable. Hirani is impeccable with his editing and CK Muraleedharan's cinematography is easy on the eyes. Aamir Khan and Rajikumar Hirani coming together was always going to be special. Three Idiots sure is. In fact, the film blends elements of Khan's Taare Zameen Par with Hirani's Munnabhai series, making a comment on the education system without going down the documentary route, but the film stands out on its own. Even as you have come to accept Khan's genius at ensuring a good product for audiences every time, this one is a Rajkumar Hirani show all the way. And it becomes easy to say that because even if you take Khan out of the equation, the film would probably make a similar impact. That is not to say having Khan doesn't help. The character of Rancho is the voice of the film, innocent yet intelligent, and the script demanded an actor of Khan's calibre to take across the film's message to audiences. As a younger man, Khan springs the kind of performance you associate him with. For the three hours that you are watching the film, Khan ceases to exist and Rancho takes over. But the real hero of Three Idiots is the guy who gave us jaadu ki jhappi and Gandhigiri. Raju Hirani, you are the man! After all the terrible films and flops this year, you have ensured that in the end, Aall Izz Well.</Review>
      <Review Id="39" Name="Nikhat Kazmi" Expected="ThumbsUp" Link="" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="24th Dec,2013" Likes="" Rating="5/5">Rest assured, all ye desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movielore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer. 3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills. The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic `humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as `Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it.</Review>

It should have been the tagline of Ramaiya Vastavaiya, the most shopworn, tired film I have seen in a while. It is a remake of a Prabhu Deva's own Telugu hit which was a remake of Maine Pyar Kiya, which itself was a refurbished version of the romances Hindi cinema was churning out in the '60s. Instead of Salman Khan and Bhagyashree, we have Girish Kumar and Shruti Haasan. Around a quarter of a century separates the two films. Why and for whom is this film being made? It is a Tips production and the lead actor is a Taurani (the producer's) scion, so it is understandable that you would want a cast-iron hit. So of course, you would reach for the oldest plot in the world: a poor- but- proud heroine, a rich- but ultimately- nice hero, an over-protective brother of the girl, and mealy-mouthed parents of the boy. The first half is spent in a large 'shaadi�wala' ghar with village belle Sona (Haasan) and the Australia-returned Ram (Kumar) making faces at each other, and then falling into each other's arms. Cue arrival of poor-but-proud bada bhaiya (Sood), so that the nasty elders (Nasser, Shah, Dhillon) can humiliate him and tell him to get out. Second half: city boy Ram shows up in the village, picks up cow dung, milks said cows, sleeps on straw pallets and eats terrible food, all to win over the bhaiya, and take his dulhan away. Each minute hangs like lead. Every single clich� in the book is thrown into the mix, with poor Poonam Dhillon as the boy's mother-from-hell, and Randhir Kapoor as the father-of- the-boy- trying hard to act sensible, having to mouth the most inane lines. I had not an iota of interest in the leads, neither in the first-timer Kumar, nor in Haasan who appears a veteran in comparison. My heart goes out to Sonu Sood who is a good actor, and who gets stuck in this kind of tripe. And why, in a Prabhu Deva film, was there not a single dance that made me want to get up and jive? He does show up in one number, but it is old and tired as his film.</Review>

Love stories especially find a way of returning every few years, in a new package with new faces and with very much the same plot. Any resemblance Ramaiya Vastavaiya bears with Maine Pyar Kiya and Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya was perhaps absolutely intended. These were blockbusters, as was the Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana - Prabhudheva's 2005 directorial debut that inspires this film (and which in turn was a copy of Maine Pyar Kiya). If producer Kumar Taurani wanted tested formula to launch son Girish Kumar, he has played it safe. The script credited to Shiraz Ahmed casts Girish as Ram, cool dude who falls for a rustic girl (Shruti Haasan). He chases her all the way to her hometown. Enter her big brother (Sonu Sood), who throws a challenge. Ram will get his girl if he produces more harvest in their field than Bade Bhaiya generally does. Prabhudheva's new film has a dated feel about it, given its story and the stereotypes it banks on. He tries making up for as much with the stock picture of frolic between the young leads besides ample melodrama. The film is funny in parts, the songs work to an extent and an overdose of mush pervades. Girish seems to lack the screen presence of a solo hero in a mainstream project. Shruti looks pretty all through but that was obviously never enough to salvage this cliched fare. Sonu Sood plays to the gallery with abundant hyper bursts. Ramaiya Vastavaiya offers nothing new. Ironic for a film meant to launch a new face.</Review>

Prabhu Deva mixes these yesteryear ingredients to dish out a formulaic film with melodious tunes and some enjoyable light moments. Ram (Girish) and Sona (Shruti) play lovers separated by the overused  ameer-gareeb boundary. He�s the rich spoilt brat from Australia while she�s a village belle whose clay horse toy and her brother (Sonu) mean the world to her! The first half has some fun and frothy situational moments, while post interval Prabhu ups the ante with Ram having to prove his love by meeting the challenge of harvesting double the crop farmed by her brother. This linear story deviates several times with  some of the most loud characters and silly slapstick jokes of recent times. What�s hot Girish Kumar�s introductory surf board scene is an antithesis of his on-screen character. Strangely that works in his favour. He has a childlike effervescence which might seem a bit odd and annoying in the beginning, but with time that becomes the reason for his likeability. He has a promising future, but we don�t know if this was the right debut vehicle. Shruti has an easy going charm about herself in her interactions with Girish. Even though they don�t have remarkable chemistry, you can sense her putting in that extra effort to hard sell their jodi. Music is above average, with the Jeena Laga Hoon track already topping charts. Sonu Sood and Vinod Khanna look their part, especially the former who doesn�t seem out of place in a rustic setting. Prabhu Deva�s guest appearance with Jacqueline in her item song adds the right zing post interval. What�s not There is a sense of disconnect between the first and second half.  Some scenes are stretched beyond requirement (bathtub and the dog encounter, long introduction to Sonu�s character, MMS leak moment at the wedding). The storyline is very reminiscent of the 1998 Salman-Kajol starrer Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya. Humour takes a severe beating with funny scenes between Girish and Paresh Ganatra looking like amateur episodes from a failed standup comedy show (a character pees on Zakir Hussain�s face!). Also the climax with the thunder claps and throwback background sound effects falls flat. There isn�t enough classic courting or romantic scenes between the leads. For a greater duration they are reduced to playing the clich�d �love me-hate me� cat and mouse game. To watch or not to If old school, loud and over-dramatic romance is your thing, then Ramaiya Vastavaiya is the ticket to buy!</Review>

There have been reports in the past that apparently most of the film has been directed by his assistant director for the star choreographer turned filmmaker had way too busy with his future projects. One look at Ramaiya Vastavaiya and you start accepting that there really must be truth in that gossip. Not that Prabhu Deva has made films that have won critics' hearts but even by his masala potboiler standards, this Shruti Haasan starrer romantic film doesn't stand a chance. Reeking of cliches of the '80s and '90s Ramaiya Vastavaiya traces the story of a poor girl Sona (Shruti Haasan) whose farmer brother (Sonu Sood) can go to any length to keep her happy. Sona scoots off to her best friend's wedding and during the course of her 15 day stay falls head over heels in love with her best friend's cousin from Australia Ram (Girish Kumar). All hell breaks loose when the elders of the family get to know of this rich-boy-poor-girl love story. Accusing the girl of maneuvering the boy to fall in love with her, they make the two break up. The girl is sent packing off back to her village but the boy soon follows her till there and on being questioned about his worthiness and love for the girl by her brother gets onto the mission to prove himself! One wonders what the target audience of this romantic saga is because there barely must be people who wouldn't have seen Maine Pyar Kiya or Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya. The movie despite being a remake of Prabhu Deva's debut Telugu hit draws heavy inspiration from the films mentioned above. The formula caper has its elements of sugary sweetness but there's no amount of painstaking labour that saves this film from being a rehash material. Even the loud over the top comedy can only work for the people who find amateurish attempts funny or derive sadist pleasure in unintentional humour. The South Indian filmmaking style can be seen in the way the characters are established or the humour is doled out which may work for the people in South but in mainstream Bollywood it only appears like a jaded and annoying product. Debutant Girish Kumar who also happens to be the producer Kumar Taurani's son gets a perfect platform to showcase every element of being a hero. Right from playing a Casanova to the love-sick pup to even the hero who beats villains to pulp, Girish can be seen profiling himself in every manner possible throughout the film, not to mention the many lovey-dovey songs and dance numbers. Shruti Haasan who has another film D-Day releasing this week itself tries too hard to play the girl-next-door, a role typified by Amrita Rao in Bollywood at present and fails terribly at it. Barring just expressions of crying and sulking Haasan barely gets to offer more. Music by Sachin Jigar works in part. While some songs grow on you slowly the others are just ear-splitting and torturous. Ramaiya Vastavaiya in short in a highly formulaic film which has absolutely nothing novel to offer. A clear case of old wine in a new bottle.</Review>

With ample chicks, hens, horns; many 'murgas', mulgis, mummyjis and baaratis. Add to this rustic beauty some colours of harvest, village belles, jadoo ki jhappi (read: item number by Jacqueline Fernandez) and of course, amidst it all - blooming romance in fields of gold. In pure Prabhudheva style - with spoonfuls of desi ghee! Ram (Girish), billionaire baap (Randhir) ka beta from Australia, lands in India for a wedding, where he's stunned to see lovely ladies bedecked in salwar-kamzeez and sarees (Whaaat? Kis khet ki mooli hai yeh?!). He falls in love with the bride's best friend, the simple gaon-ki-chori, Sona (Shruti). She's forced to leave him, but Ram follows her to the village and swears to win over her bhaiya, the proud kisaan, Raghuvir (Sonu). The billion-dollar-baby turns desi-cool - He ploughs, milks the cows (even puts them on a diet), and does a 'shitload' of work (with gobar, ghaas, et al). The film (remake of Prabhudheva's debut directorial Telugu film) isn't ripe with any newness - in story or direction. In fact, it discernibly replants stories from the 80's-90's era (remember: 'Maine Pyar Kiya', 'Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya'), with cliches, a banal plot, an field-full of supporting cast (of which Kapoor and Khanna are underused but good) and a budding lead pair. Debutant Girish makes a splash of an entry (surfing in blue seas, 'Bond' babes take a bow), and dances with flair. His overly exuberant performance seems flaky in the first half. Later, when he turns from a cool to kisaan, he breaks loose and performs a tad better. Shruti looks the desi beauty; her performance is not striking, yet likeable. Sonu is the best of the 'crop', his years of labour as an actor shows. There are few good laughs, doses of sweetness and fresh melodies (Sachin-Jigar), but sadly even that is mowed down by heightened histrionics, routine dialogues and a trite tale. This one's like a pretty field decked up in celebration, but with no real harvest to show.</Review>

'Wake Up Sid' director Ayan Mukerji takes us on a familiar journey through holiday romances, family conundrums, and big fat Indian weddings. It's predictable every step of the way, but Mukerji has a superb cast that never slips, even when his script does. The film is predictable every step of the way, but director Ayan Mukerji has a superb cast that never slips, even when his script does. Straight-laced 'Scholar Naina' (Deepika Padukone) has little in common with thrill-seeking Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) when she joins him and his two best friends - Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) and Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) - on a trip to Manali. But after a series of collective experiences, including a messy run-in with the locals, a midnight trek to a high-altitude peak, and intoxicated Holi celebrations, she's lost her inhibitions and also her heart. Too bad Bunny is focused on chasing his dream to travel the world, unwilling to let anything or anyone hold him back. When they're all reunited at a wedding eight years later, Bunny must ask himself if he really wants to make the same choices all over again. Although writer-director Ayan Mukerji sets his story in a world far from 'Wake Up Sid', he still has his hero go through an existential crisis in both life and love. If his first film was about a slacker finding a purpose, the message in 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is that life can pass you by, if you don't stop to savor the moments. This idea, however, is couched in the template of a dozen love stories starting from 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' and 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. It's a pity the treatment has a been-there-seen-that feel to it because there are some modern ideas hidden underneath all that fluff. Part of what makes 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' warm and fuzzy is the friendship that Bunny and his die-hard buddies Aditi and Avi share, despite their shifting dynamics over eight years. Mukerji understands and nicely puts across the bittersweet qualities that friendships go through, and more often than once I found myself misty-eyed. Even love is viewed rather practically by the four key characters here - it's nice if you've found someone, but it needn't be the end of the world if you're not in a relationship. It's refreshing also that Mukerji doesn't tie up all the loose ends in the movie; not everyone gets the perfect happy ending. These are, however, small mercies in a film that smacks of assembly line reproduction. The high-gloss, picture-postcard cinematography, the gilt-edged production design, and the unending scenes of wedding revelry and over-choreographed dance numbers have that distinct Dharma Productions stamp on them, each frame oozing excess. Still, they're a lot less clumsy than the scenes of faux realism - like that entirely needless prologue in a Mumbai brothel where Bunny breaks into a dance with a hooker, even if she is played by Madhuri Dixit. Equally unconvincing is the intended grittiness in a sequence where an older Bunny, now a documentary film cameraman, daringly ventures into a seedy European ghetto shooting drug peddlers on the sly. Many of the film's problems, fortunately, are smoothened out by the terrific cast. Kalki Koechlin invests heart and spunkiness to the part of brash tomboy Aditi who is the glue that binds this group, while Aditya Roy Kapur is entirely likeable as the goofy Avi. The film benefits even from the spot-on timing of bit players like Dolly Ahluwalia and Kunal Roy Kapur, while Farooque Shaikh melts your heart in a two-scene cameo. Ranbir Kapoor turns on the charm in full heartthrob mode. He's pitch-perfect as the devil-may-care wanderer and flirt, and yet chokes you up in the more vulnerable, sensitive flashes. It's difficult to stand out in the same frame as Ranbir, but Deepika Padukone knocks it out of the park as Naina. She brings a lovely innocence to the early scenes, and then an understated sexiness when we meet her again in the film's second half. The pair sparks off each other, displaying a searing chemistry that neither has shared with other co-stars. Too long by at least twenty minutes, this is a watchable film despite its conventional arc. Fans of 'Wake Up Sid' will likely miss the original voice Mukerji revealed in his surprisingly mature debut, but with this one he shows he can do formula with as much ease. I'm going with three out of five for 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. If light-hearted mush is what you're seeking, you're looking in the right place.</Review>
      <Review Id="46" Name="Sukanya Verma" Expected="ThumbsDown" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-yeh-jaawani-hai-deewani-is-totally-worth-it/20130531.htm" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="31st May,2013" Likes="" Rating="3.5/5">You can�t have it all. You will miss out on some things. So why not enjoy what�s in hand?� recommends Naina enjoying the gorgeous view from a vantage point of a grand fort, just few minutes short of witnessing a breathtaking sunset. Bunny, the recipient of her suggestion, reluctantly agrees. They have a good evening. Director Ayan Mukerji�s second endeavour, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani works exactly like this scene from the movie. You know that content smile you return with after spending time in fond company over effortless laughter and magical connections? That. The opposites attract genre isn�t path-breaking. Like �dal chawal� which is an oft-used analogy in the romance, certain inevitability is a given. So you always know what it�s about, where it�s headed, what it�ll deliver but if it can still be fun then, the challenge is more than fulfilled.  Mukerji has crafted a film about characters he clearly cares about and wants you to do the same, where even if the conclusion is a tad convenient, it�s the one you want to see. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is about four friends, their camaraderie, adventures, discoveries, dreams and decisions over a mountain holiday and a destination wedding. (Here, parents are mostly on the periphery except a fleeting interaction with Bunny and Naina�s.) Click! It�s a perfectly glamorous setting (shot by V Manikandan) and gives him abundant opportunity to live it up in a manner his producer Karan Johar can feel either proud or outdone. But I am pretty sure it�s the first one considering the magnanimity he�s shown in loosening the purse strings -- some thousand champagne glasses are destroyed for a stunning slo-mo second of a lavish party song.  But he has his own disarming style. His protagonists are not mere character sketches but a beautiful version of people you know/knew.  Remember that boy in class who could fix everything with a smile and get away saying the most outrageous things without batting an eyelid? Or his best friend and partner-in-crime who backed all that wild behaviour by contributing plenty of his own? How their singular aim is to drink and get everyone drunk -- those seemingly careless blokes who secretly care a great deal. Or the hard-talking �one of the boys� girl with enough feisty bones in her petite frame to give Manali�s bullies a run for their money? And, most importantly, that shy girl that brought out the Shah Rukh Khan in every boy, the one you wish to �palat�? Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor), Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) and Naina (Deepika Padukone) -- they�re all a product of those same filmi values and fascination, where ice can be broken over something as simple and silly as Bachchan�s strenuous moves in Jumma Chumma De De (Hum). And this I loved about YJHD, how Bollywood runs subconsciously in their blood -- the approach makes a world of a difference to the narrative. The upshot is a sublime celebration not a done-to-death tribute. At a little less than three hours running time, YJHD is essentially two chapters. In the first half, the foursome hang out in the picturesque, snow-clad hill station of Manali to engage in trekking, adventures, mandatory dimwits, jealousy and coming-of-age. Mukerji cultivates the blossoming chemistry between the travel aficionado Bunny and Neuroimmunology-studying Naina at leisure. Their moments always end on a poetic ellipsis, the attraction must bear slow-brewing conviction, he prioritises. It�s a good call by the young filmmaker since it certainly helps the emotionality during the second phase of their affinity, which has an underlining philosophy of true love bringing out the best in a person. Of course, since the events take place around a fancy Udaipur wedding (where you actually see brief glimpses of the extent of preparation that goes in high-society festivities), the leading quartet finds more reasons to party. The pace does drop intermittently for the sake of accommodating brightly-picturised songs (composed by Pritam) but its crisply-written script doles out enough humour to complement the inevitable sentimentality. I, for one, simply loved the uncomplicated, blunt wit of Hussain Dalal�s chuckle-worthy dialogues (Abbe dhongi, tu cheating nahi karta toh ab tak fourth standard mein hi hota, Venice, Europe ka dharavi hai). Moreover, Mukerji�s actors appear to understand his vision intimately.  Ranbir Kapoor is perfectly cast as the hippie-at-heart Bunny.  Whether he�s sipping Roohafza with his dad (Farookh Shaikh, two scenes is all it takes to convey brilliance), telling Deepika Padukone how special she is, fondly referring to his gal pal Kalki as �Mere Cheetah� or shaking a leg with a tantalising Madhuri Dixit, the extent of romanticism, charisma and verve he conveys; lends YJHD all the personality it needs.  Kalki Koechlin is precious as the emo turned Emma and induces a big grin every time she gets hostile, �Tere baap ke sandwiches hain kya?� Aditya Roy Kapur is somewhat overshadowed but his droopy shoulders and smiley-faced indifference conceal a story that�s only implied never realised to focus on the sweeping chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika. They�ve worked before (in Bachna Ae Haseeno) but the timing in YJHD is something else. Also, Deepika has never looked this radiant and fragile. She exudes grace and sensitivity as Naina, not quite the filmi definition of nerd. She wears glasses but her frames are stylish not over-sized monstrosities designed to make her look unsightly. She is quite a sharp dresser (unless your idea of chic is Evelyn Sharma�s tacky wardrobe). Sure, she prays. But there�s none of that exasperating Katrina Kaif�s barter approach with God. Naina is reserved and self-conscious and one endearing scene, �You�re dying to party, right?� captures the core of her soul perfectly.  Often change is depicted with a makeover in our movies. Here too, all four, go from college teens to professional adults in their late 20s. They do start dressing differently. There�s a certain refinement that comes with age and making money after all. But they don�t change, they just grow up. Their essence remains unaffected. Avi is still the playful, reckless charmer with a drink in hand. Naina�s competitive streak surfaces during the bride versus groom sangeet program. Aditi�s wardrobe is all ladylike but she hasn�t lost an ounce of her lively spunk. And Bunny is unpredictable as ever. Something Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is not. But who cares? Romance is back with a bang and it is exuberant, entertaining, dazzling and worth your time.</Review>

This is not the sort of amnesia that you have to force yourself into after a bad, blah film. This is because I've seen this brand new film, and its characters so many, many times before. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a been-here, seen-this, much-too-long glossy creature, and not much else. Ranbir Kapoor plays the I-want-to-fly fellow who doesn't want to be tied down. Familiar? Oh yeah, we've seen a hundred variations of Bunny aka Kabir Thapar. Deepika Padukone is Naina, the proverbial girl in the glasses, always with her nose buried in a book, always driven to doing the right thing. Seen that before? So when Bunny and Naina meet and bicker and get intense and part, we know where this is headed. Which we are ready for, because that's what romantic comedies are about. But the thing with the best rom-coms is how the oldest story in the world � boy meets girl, and they live happily ever after � gets a fresh telling. On that crucial test, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani scores low. The supporting parts, essayed by Kalki Koechlin and Aditya Roy Kapur, her as the cool chick who then does the conventional thing like saying yes to an arranged marriage, and him as the hero's best buddy who turns hostile for no convincing reason, are also cobbled from bits and pieces. Because it is a Karan Johar production, we get the big fat Indian wedding, the geet and the sangeet and the whole zardozi, lehnga, mehndi, shebang, in multifarious doses. We also get Madhuri Dixit as Item Girl, and she blanks out as soon as she's out of sight, too. Ayan Mukherji had debuted in 2009 with Wake Up Sid starring Ranbir Kapoor, and that was a coming-of-age-of-urban-slacker-romance with some nuance. Here, he throws spikiness to the winds, and gives us glitter. Which is fine up to a point. Who doesn't like to see shiny, happy people doing shiny, happy things? But then when you start wanting more, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani gets into its long length of templates and tropes. That high-on-energy Ranbir shake-shake Badtameez Dil had my foot tapping, but hey, we know he's a good dancer. So what's new? The foursome gets to spend time in Manali in the first half, where they squeal and giggle and play pranks and look a little older than they should. Post interval, they are in Udaipur (Ranbir also gets to swan around pretty places in Europe and LA, so we can see what a hot shot photographer he's become), doing the marriage thing, and the cementing-the-cracks-in-friendship thing, and the return-of-the-prodigal thing. It is Ranbir, and a few of his climactic moments with Deepika (they begin with distressingly little going on between them), as well as a few emotive scenes with Farooq Shaikh, who plays his father, that stay with you. The Kapoor lad gets a nice matter-of-factness to loverboy self, and allows himself to be overcome when the time is right. One of these days, someone in this new-age Bollywood will make a cracking romance, and cast Ranbir as the lover, and give him something true to do. Now that will be something to watch.</Review>

Still scared of commitment, still wants to be the free bird but now he has a steady job for sustenance. The all-important factor of mush floats in with the film's heroine who is, of course, his polar opposite - focussed, respects family values but leads a claustrophobic life. Ayan Mukerji's second film is exactly the second film you would expect from director who made his debut with Wake Up Sid, driven by the pros and cons that come in the wake. You have here a slightly more mature Ayan as storyteller, and technically his craft is a few notches higher too. Yet just like Bunny, the funnily named protagonist played by Ranbir Kapoor, Ayan's cinematic idiom still seems trapped in a happy-go-lucky teenage universe. Ranbir (and Deepika) fans are bound to find that bit cute. The film has packaged its lead duo smartly to live up to its jawaani-deewani tag. It's more of jawaani than deewani, though. The joys, hopes, angst and despair of youth are all served with a designer-perfect punch through the story of four youngsters. But the film seems to lack a certain passion and guts to push the envelope while portraying today's youth. If Ranbir Kapoor has come to define GenNow Bollywood for most, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is packaged almost entirely around its hero. At the same time a rom-com, a road movie and a coming-of-age trip, Ayan's new film should keep its target audience - the urban multiplex crowd - happy. Ranbir's Bunny is a videographer for a TV travel show while Deepika plays Naina, doctor in the making who takes off on a trek trip to Manali to let off steam. Their few good traits will evidently rub off on each other. Tagged along are Bunny's buddies, the drifter Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and the tomboy Aditi (Kalki). Naina joins the wild trio and is obviously the odd one out. The holiday ends, the foursome parts ways, only to reunite years later at Aditi's marriage (yes, it's a K.Jo production so we won't miss the scope for the shaadi naach gaana). What follows is meant to twist the Bollywood romance. It doesn't, quite. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, lovable as it is, simply refuses to move beyond box-office diktats. Well-penned roles are in order for Aditya and Kalki, although they get restrained footage. Both actors impress despite staying in Ranbir and Deepika's shadows. Ayan scripts a fantastic scope for chemistry for his lead duo and Ranbir-Deepika live it up. The sizzle they share remains the film's highlight. Ranbir fans in particular would invariably notice how he smoothly continues growing as an actor-superstar. And yeah... he does well to match Madhuri Dixit's groove step for step, doesn't he?</Review>

What it certainly is not is ballsy. For all the big ideas about life and the dilemmas of youth that it tosses up in the air over a runtime that?s 20 minutes shy of three hours, it always opts to play safe, vacillating between thoughts of rebellion and acts of conformity. The characters spout familiar platitudes to each other: live your dream, get a life and move on, stop pitying yourself and learn to love thyself?We have seen and heard it all before. In the first half of the film, four happy-go-lucky school buddies with superficially defined traits reunite to go on a trekking trip to Manali and beyond. Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) is footloose and dreams of exploring the world. Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) is wild and fancy-free. Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a drifter happy to blow up his cash on cricket bets. Naina (Deepika Padukone) is the odd one out. She is a bespectacled and sedate medical student. She joins the gang in an act of impulsive defiance but cannot break away from her neuro-immunology textbook even as the rest of the traveling party live it up on the road. By the end of the adventure-filled sojourn through the ups and downs of the undulating landscape, each of the four is transformed a little, but only to go his/her way. Eight years later, one of the two girls in the group, Aditi, decides to marry a straight-laced engineer (Kunaal Roy Kapur) and her old friends descend on a resort in Udaipur for the grand betrothal. And like they did the first time around, they come and go talking about love, friendship and the need to grow up even as they consume a whole lot of liquor. Between the swigs, love and friendship do happen, but the quartet does not quite grow up. The high-flying Bunny, after several years of globe-trotting as a television cameraman, talks of the pleasure of watching Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. In response, the more rooted Naina extols the joy of seeing Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge with a tub of popcorn at Maratha Mandir. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is clearly more of the latter than the former although it does occasionally betray the ambition to be larger in scope than what it is capable of. It is a mildly diverting film at best. Its musical set pieces are robustly staged and with Ranbir Kapoor at the centre of them all, they are fun while they last. The characters are rather sketchily etched and the psychological bends that they encounter on the way to self-realization are far too simplistic to catch the audience by surprise. Neither the romance nor the drama that the film seeks to whip up can salvage it from being just another harmless romp aimed at an undemanding audience that is comfortable with swimming at the shallow end of life. There is no denying, however, that Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is gorgeously filmed, the locations are eye-popping, and the guys and dolls that people the tale are a bunch of attractive people. The two lead actors, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, do make a fetching onscreen pair. And they are well complemented by Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin. It is the erratic narrative arc that is a letdown. Overlong, sluggish and fluffy, it meanders through varied locations as the young lovers/friends seek to reconnect with each other after a few years of being apart. The song and dance routines, no matter how foot-tapping they are, do not quite possess the kind of infectious energy that can offset the clich?s around which they are wrapped and turn the film into something more than just superficially enjoyable. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a mix of Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, with dollops of 3 Idiots thrown in for good measure. It is all served up in a Karan Johar-style concoction where the backdrops ? both indoors and the locations ? are infinitely more expressive than the inner worlds of the young characters. The impulses of the quartet of friends, who predictably include one couple that is on the verge of a lifelong relationship but are either unable or not keen enough to express their love for each other, are hardly explained in logical and convincing terms. As a result, the fragmented storyline hurtles forward only in fits and starts. The heroine is head over heels in love. The boy she is smitten with is averse to making a commitment. The girl is unable to communicate her true feelings. So you know exactly what the outcome is going to be. They will keep crossing each other?s path until true love is found. Director Ayan Mukherji, who gave an impressive account of himself in his debut film, Wake Up Sid, appears to have allowed the skills that he displayed the first time around to go into deep slumber. Not that Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a sleeping pill. It is not. But it could certainly have done with a little more narrative verve. Do make it a point to get into your seat before the show begins. Madhuri Dixit?s item song plays out ten minutes into the film. Watch Ranbir Kapoor match steps with the still-lustrous diva and you know why this guy is special. Watch Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani for him.</Review>

The thriller, set against the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war, is, in equal parts, muddled and related stories moving. There are sequences of power and eloquence. And passages in the first half that had me so confused that I couldn't figure out who was chasing whom. Director Shoojit Sircar has tacked on an awkward framing device, which has Major Vikram Singh, played by John Abraham, narrating the entire story to a priest in a church. Why was this necessary? I don't know. The film begins with a disclaimer that it is a work of fiction. Names have been changed but the events of Madras Caf?re clearly based in the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, which ultimately led to the assassination of Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Here, the plot moves inexorably towards the assassination of a former prime minister. Major Vikram is an intelligence officer with the Indian army enlisted in a covert operation to broker peace in the war-torn country. The film cuts rapidly between New Delhi, London, Bangkok and Kerala. There are high-powered meetings in Delhi in which powerful men give clipped orders like *Humein har halat mein Anna chahiye*. But missions are derailed by bloody betrayals on the ground. We also have Nargis Fakhri in an ill-defined role of a war journalist, who grimly tells Vikram: *They know your first move before you even implement it*. Throughout the film, she speaks in English and he replies in Hindi, which makes for clumsy conversation. And yet, Madras Caf?orks as an effective portrait of the futility of war. Shoojit and his writers, Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Somnath Dey, ably illustrate why there are no winners here. Ideologies are marred by corruption and brutality. Death is inevitable and victories, pyrrhic. A special mention here of John Abraham, who stretches himself as both actor and producer. He does a commendable job. As does Prakash Belawadi, who plays Vikram*s hard-drinking superior. And cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi, whose camera gives the film scale and heft. Shantanu Moitra*s unobtrusive music underlines the tragedy. Madras Cafe's flawed but ambitious and brave. I recommend you make time for it.</Review>

Political pressures and sensitive groups invariably throw a spanner in the works. Which is why it's commendable what director Shoojit Sircar has undertaken with 'Madras Caf? Set in the late 80s and early 90s during the civil war in Sri Lanka, the film meshes fact and fiction competently to present a dramatized account of the real-life conspiracy behind the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. There's a lot going on in this dense script (by Somnath Dey and Shubhendu Bhattacharya) which spends the first half hour or so of the film laying out the geopolitical history of the region and the times. Through voiceovers and occasionally confusing scenes, we're provided a background to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, led by rebel group LTTE, who're referred to as LTF in this film. We're also told of the IPKF (or the Indian Peace Keeping Force) that was deployed to cool off the tension in Sri Lanka, but who got in the way of the LTTE. And we're introduced to Anna (Ajay Ratnam), head of the LTF, modelled so closely after LTTE chief Prabhakaran who famously masterminded that dastardly killing. But the film's plot kicks in when military intelligence officer Vikram Singh (John Abraham) is dispatched to Jaffna on a covert mission to weaken Anna's stranglehold on the region. With the help of a British Asian journalist (Nargis Fakhri), Vikram uncovers a daring conspiracy involving foreign players and key figures in the Indian bureaucracy. Despite the crisp pacing, the film's first half will likely be a slog for anyone unfamiliar with the subcontinent's recent political history. It doesn't help that the writers stuff too much information into these portions, often digressing from the central assassination conspiracy, which remains the film's key strength. 'Madras Caf?feels more surefooted in its second half when it slips into race-against-time thriller mode. The unfolding of the assassination plot, the decoding of crucial intel, and the chilling explosion itself is remarkably shot and edited, and leaves you shaken despite the inevitability of that climax. What feels clunky, however, is the framing device Sircar employs to tell his story. A grizzly Vikram narrates the events in flashback, thereby diluting the emotional impact of the terrifying assassination scene. Portions featuring Vikram and his wife slacken the pace, particularly one clumsily written love scene. But these are minor complaints in an otherwise slick film that gets so many things just right. Sircar avoids over-familiar faces in the film, and makes interesting casting choices across the board, particularly Siddhartha Basu in the part of R&amp;AW chief Robin Dutt. John Abraham himself nicely slips into the skin of a committed officer tasked with protecting the nation, and he's particularly at ease in scenes where he's out there in the trenches facing the enemy, gun in hand. Even Nargis Fakhri is pleasantly competent as the strictly English-speaking reporter. Solidly directed by Sircar, who steers clear of typical Bollywood machismo and avoids oversimplifying characters or their motives, the film - at a little over two hours - is a compelling watch. I'm going with three-and-a-half out of five for 'Madras Caf? Until the climate is more conducive for filmmakers to boldly make real-life stories without fear of controversy or censorship, this may be the best way to approach important stories that must be told.</Review>

The veracity of one pitched against the ingenuity of another can produce awe-inspiring results. Though not entirely above faults, Shoojit Sircar*s Madras Cafe marries the two to direct an engaging political thriller about a fictional character*s experience against real events and references, namely Sri Lankan Civil War and the assassination of ex-Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi. This person, an Indian military officer Vikram Singh, played by co-producer John Abraham, is assigned by RAW chief, Robin Dutt (Siddharth Basu) to conduct covert operations in Sri Lankan city Jaffna. This is RAW. Use brains not muscle, Dutt tells him. It*s a mantra Madras Cafe follows religiously steering clear of typically Bollywood brand of action even though there are several moments of heavy-duty gun-firing and aggression. Once in war zone, Vikram reports to his superior Bala (Prakash Belawadi) and bumps into London-based war correspondent Jaya (Nargis Fakhri) before channeling his energy to track down the activities of LTF boss Anna Bhaskaran (Ajay Ratnam) and lure his political ally Shri (Kannan Arunachalam) to go against the former. What follows is Vikram*s close encounter with gun-toting extremists who view themselves as revolutionaries and determining the dangerous conspiracy to kill an important Indian leader with a human bomb. Told in flashback, Madras Cafe starts out a tad awkwardly with an unnaturally dishevelled John Abraham relating shocking episodes and expounding on the futility of violence. His part Hindi, part English voice-over painstakingly explains the history of Sri Lanka*s ethnic crisis, India*s intervention, the formation of LTF (modelled around Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam), the subsequent civil war and its death toll. The screen too is filled with visuals encapsulating a long, painful past within few minutes. For about one hour, Madras Cafe, written by Somnath Dey and Shubendu Bhattacharya with Juhi Chaturvedi*s dialogues, concerns itself with build-up and laying out a complex network of inquiry, motives and ideology. The *thriller* aspect of this political drama, dedicated to the events between mid 1980s to early 1990s, comes alive post-interval with its breakneck pace, crisp editing (Chandrashekhar Prajapati) and precise screenplay. All those knotted ends in the beginning now begin to unravel with fascinating ease. Even when characters face personal setbacks, Madras Caf?oesn't pause for melodrama. Sircar adopts a tone akin to Siddharth Basu*s demanding bureaucrat, there*s a clinical straightness to his glossy treatment (think Blood Diamond, Green Zone) of a highly volatile subject. While I would have also loved qualities like sharp and sly, the restraint helps in concealing his leading actor*s dramatic limitations. As tempting it is to think what an Irrfan Khan or Abhay Deol would do in John Abraham*s role, I must compliment him on playing it solemn and fit. The gorgeously shot (Kamaljeet Negi) Madras Cafe also benefits by not opting for the usual faces to play key supporting characters, lending its ambiance an air of novelty if not unpredictability. Ratnam, Arunachalam and Belwadi do a fairly convincing job while Basu appears comfortable in his new role. Cannot say the same about journalist Dibang*s turn as a Bangkok residing informer. His self-conscious screen presence completely dilutes the gravity of his only scene. Raashi Khanna doesn't get a chance to flex her potential as John Abraham*s young wife unlike the other female actor in the film -- Nargis Fakhri. There*s bright and there*s pretend bright and the distinction comes through when she conducts an interview with a dreaded leader of a feared organization, which is devoid of any tension or edge, like say, Mani Ratnam*s Dil Se... While her dialogue delivery isn't a problem given all her lines are in English, Fakhri*s conversations with John Abraham are unnecessarily jarring. She speaks English, he responds in Hindi. Why such stinginess over subtitles? In any case, she lost me at *anyways.* At its running time of two hours, ten minutes, Shoojit Sircar*s Madras Cafe is a swift, smart and serious study of an inglorious chapter of political history. It doesn't take names but doesn't hold back either. Even if it packs in classic stereotypes of this genre and the climax is something we all know and vividly remember, the horridness of it continues to startle. After experiencing back-to-back idiocy on big screen, it*s refreshing to return to the theatres for a film that expects you to be educated, informed and attentive. Give it a chance, Madras Cafe deserves an audience.</Review>
      <Review Id="53" Name="Shubra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/movie-review-madras-cafe/1159133/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="24th August, 2013" Likes="29" Rating="3/5">The difficulties of attempting a true-blue Bollywood political thriller are evident in Madras Caf?Director Shoojit Sircar places his film at the height of the civil war in Sri Lanka in the late '80s and early '90s, and it culminates in the assassination of an Indian political figure who closely resembles Rajiv Gandhi, but he (Sircar) is clearly constrained in naming names. Yes, Sri Lanka is Sri Lanka, and Jaffna is Jaffna, but too often, the characters in the film call it, awkwardly, 'the island'. Not once is Rajiv Gandhi named: the actor who plays him is a look-alike, but he is consistently referred to as the 'ex-Prime Minister'. Rebel force LTTE, which spearheaded the demand for a 'separate Tamil homeland (Eelam)' is called LTF in the film. And LTTE chief Prabhakaran, the man behind Rajiv's assassination, becomes Anna (Rathnam). Still, props to Sircar for pulling off, more or less, an I-spy fast-paced saga which has resonance. John Abraham plays a fictional army officer suborned by RAW, who is sent off to Jaffna for a covert operation. Those with long memories will remember how Sri Lanka's war had spilled over into the international arena, and how the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) had become the target of LTTE ire, and caused much political heartburn in India. India's attempt at keeping peace in the island nation had been one of Rajiv Gandhi's missions, which came to a rocky, controversial end, and which, directly and indirectly, caused his own tragic end . Vikram Singh (Abraham) reports to local superior Bala (Belawade) in Lanka, and tries to break away Anna's supporters: the idea is to defame Anna, and ensure the return of peace. Meanwhile, a mysterious Indian is busy hatching a conspiracy with some foreign players at a fictional Madras Caf?those involved do not want a political solution, their interest is in keeping the strife going, the loss of innocent lives be damned.</Review>
      <Review Id="54" Name="Karan Anshuman" Expected="" Link="http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Film-review-Madras-Cafe/articleshow/22003606.cms" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="23rd August, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">Attached to Madras Cafe are the trailers of Zanjeer, Boss, and Phata Poster Nikla Hero. Not to judge the films by their trailers, but it's uncanny how similar the three look and feel in their common styles borrowed (now appropriated) from commercial South-Indian potboilers: violent B-movies laced with in-your-face humor and a sprinkling of romance. Not to mention the lot we've suffered so far: Himmatwala, Policegiri, Zila Ghaziabad, and their kin. Madras Cafe bravely bucks the trend. A politically astute (sensitive?) mainstream film spanning the years from 1987-1991, with established actors, no songs, and uncompromised detailing; it is the fictionalized account of events leading up to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. In a predictable trend, if a film's opening titles are a classic text-on-black you may assume with near certainty that it is going to be a sensible film. Not that experimenting with opening credits doesn't often make for sensible cinema, but the simplicity of the concept usually foretells complexity of the story to follow. And Madras Cafe is a complicated film. Somnath Dey and Shubendu Bhattacharya's screenplay's form is impressively inspired from Hollywood political thrillers. Syriana and Green Zone come to mind, but there are fewer tracks to follow here. A barrage of information upfront outlines the tempestuous politics of Lanka, and the evolution of the Tamil separatists incarnating as the Tamil Tigers. The writers stick to the winding handrail of larger, known facts deftly inserting the stairs in the form of a fictional account of an army officer who is R&amp;AW's go-to man in Jaffna. Occasionally, however, they glean over what could've construed a critical appraisal of the workings and decisions of the Indian government at the time. It would've been clever to make more direct connections with the flip-flop the Indian authorities were playing with the LTTE. Never indicated in the film for example, is that Gandhi's assassin Thenmozhi Rajaratnam was allegedly a product of official training provided by R&amp;AW! But this is a minor quibble, the problem with the writing is that it seems the script would've read like a docudrama. More docu, less drama. The writers often struggle to balance explaining the scene, rather than staging it. The makers get caught up in documentary footage, B&amp;W photos, supers, and sporadic subtitles to keep the viewer well armed like a Wiki page, but somewhere miss the opportunity to create more memorable scenes where the action and characters are all that matter. To be fair, though Vikram Singh's (John Abraham) moment of personal loss is exceptionally well handled by Shoojit Sircar as is the third act of the film, when the drama builds up nicely, hurtling towards the inevitability of the assassination. To go the distance in a pre-determined finale with no silver lining is a brave, applause-worthy move on its own. It almost makes the context and preceding two-thirds irrelevant. Sircar's strength as a director shines in the excellent detailing: the edging in of Western culture in the jungles of Jaffna in the form of Coca Cola, the corridors of R&amp;AW, period-specific trivialities, and perfect synchronization of the technical departments. Keep a tab on this director. Bigger, better things are yet to come from him yet, I suspect. One of John Abraham's more nuanced performances (remember, we last saw him in Shootout at Wadala), he is perfectly convincing as the man in charge of ops in Jaffna. His exchanges with the UK-based reporter played by Nargis Fakhri are less plausible. She speaks in English. He replies in Hindi. After a very shaky opening scene, she gets more comfortable in her role doling out her sources to the officer. Siddartha Basu in his first movie role is more than in control. Other actors that deserve mention include Prakash Belawadi and the superbly cast Rashi Khanna as the pining army wife. Even though the film ever-so-slightly under-delivers, we should be blessed that it got made at all. There is outrage from the strangest nooks of the country over flimsiest of issues in our films, and Abraham and Sircar would've been well aware of what they're embarking on. But this charged political thriller, despite its flaws, is a leap in the right direction - away from that other "Madras"-titled film and its ilk - that deserves our support. If nothing else, it'll give you an acute insight and a timely reminder of the turmoil our neighbors went through and our country's confounding contribution to the matter.</Review>

You could go hyper on jingoism and rake in the moolah as so many mainstream films have done so often. Or, you could try catering realistic, riveting fare but that will always leave nagging doubts at the box-office. Madras Cafe represents more than good entertainment, in this context. The fact that it takes the second route and gets a solo release in Bollywood this week proves there is a ready audience now - specifically in the urban multiplexes - for films that enthral and inform at the same time. This box-office dynamic is in stark contrast to the time when director Shoojit Sircar made his debut with Yahaan in 2005. That film laying bare terrorism-ravaged Kashmir belonged to the same genre as Madras Cafe. But back then it went unnoticed despite its quality. Madras Cafe is a thriller about Sri Lanka in the time of civil war, and how that sordid chapter and its socio-political aftermath led to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. There is a point worth note here. Despite being brave enough to showcase a sensitive slice of history, new Bollywood still does not reveal the courage to take real names. So a twist in imagination makes Rajiv Gandhi into a figure perennially referred to as "ex-PM" in the film. LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) becomes LTF and the militant group's formidable leader Prabhakaran is named Anna (incidentally, Prabhakaran was called Anna by his people). In a nation where protest groups are forever hungering for mischief (the film has already drawn wrath in Tamil Nadu over the Anna/LTF portrayal), one understands we are still some way off from making direct references as, say, Body Of Lies or Green Zone (you do spot stylistic influences of both these films though Madras Cafe tells an original story). In his best performance yet, John Abraham puts up a restrained act as Vikram Singh, armyman on a covert RAW mission in Sri Lanka. His probe, as well as interactions with a British war correspondent Jaya (Nargis Fakhri, mercifully getting English dialogues all through), tells him there is a sinister plan aimed at India beneath the rebel activity. Only too late does Vikram realise it could have to do with an attack on the ex-PM. Madras Cafe cocktails its political narrative with superbly scripted suspense. The film is not strictly about war. Rather, the screenplay (Somnath Dey and Shubendu Bhattacharya) creates an engaging spy thriller with its focus on the grime behind intelligence ops and the societal implications of rebellion. If Sircar cannot resist a comment or two, it is served very quietly, smartly. The film tells a story we already knew. Yet it scores because of the way Sircar maintains intrigue, teasing viewers with regular twists. Irresistible stuff if you love brain work in your movies.</Review>
      <Review Id="56" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/madras-cafe-movie-review-862" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="22nd August, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="4/5">Madras Cafe is a sinewy and riveting espionage thriller that entertains without having to play to the gallery. That isn't the only departure from norm that director Shoojit Sircar makes. He also attempts a risky tightrope walk between staying true to recent geopolitical history and the need to serve up an imagined, dramatised spy story. He succeeds on both counts. At no point does Madras Cafe appear to be in danger of losing its balance and plummeting into a void. Sircar hits the right strides, and blends fact and fiction with great narrative aplomb and visual flair. Madras Cafe draws upon actual events that are still fresh in the nation*s collective memory and crafts a compelling and fast-paced political drama. The story hinges on a conspiracy theory that links the assassination of a pacifist ex-Prime Minister to the machinations of giant corporations and foreign agencies out to destabilise the subcontinent. That central plot trigger might seem stretched and fanciful to some, but in terms of both style and treatment, Madras Cafe is remarkably restrained and yet makes for compelling viewing. There are no heroes and villains here for Sircar is clearly not interested in turning the film into an oversimplified, hackneyed good versus evil yarn. It is driven more by its overarching theme * it rests on a conflict of attrition between ethnic and political opponents that has no winners or losers * than by its characters, intriguing as they might be. At the centre of the drama are an undercover intelligence agent Vikram Singh (John Abraham) and a London-based war correspondent Jaya Sahni (Nargis Fakhri) who are up against daunting odds in a war zone. Neither, however, possesses the attributes of larger-than-life daredevils. Madras Cafe stands apart from run-of-the-mill smack-downs because it does not celebrate vacuous militaristic machismo. What the film does instead is bring home the horrors of a civil war and its human ramifications. The writers (Somnath Dey, Shubendu Bhattacharya) obviously have their hearts in the right place. And so undeniably does the director. He constructs an account of what might have happened in the last two and a half years leading up to the elimination of an Indian political leader by the world*s first-ever human bomb. From the opening scene of a brutal terror attack on a bus in Jaffna to the climactic explosion that shatters the hero*s hopes of stopping a heinous act, Madras Cafe does not let go of its grip on the audience for even a moment. Its muscles stem primarily from its steadfast eschewal of narrative conventions that are a part and parcel of spy thrillers. For one, the male protagonist is no superhero primed to perform acts of logic-defying bravado. The only *grand* statement of intent that he is allowed to make is, *I will do it my way*. It turns out that it easier said than done for he is in a game that is controlled by forces and agencies that are far bigger than him. He is only an ordinary army officer who is sent to strife-torn northern Sri Lanka on an undercover mission in the early 1990s after the pullout of the Indian peacekeeping forces from the island. His brief is to spread disaffection within the ranks of an intransigent rebel group that refuses to fall in line with the peace accord. He has the official mandate from his bosses in New Delhi (Siddharth Basu as the RAW chief, Piyush Pandey as the Cabinet Secretary, among other) to adopt the methods that he deems fit. On the ground, however, treachery is rife and leaks from within the organisation pushes him repeatedly into deadly traps laid by the adversary. It is a world where danger lurks at every corner and violence erupts without much warning. Worst of all, in the shadows, it is difficult to tell friend from foe. Most of the real historical markers are all in place and the filmmaker takes only minor liberties with issues of chronology and detail. But the names given to the key individuals and organisations engaged in the Sri Lankan civil war are strictly in the realms of fiction. The Indian Prime Minister who signs the agreement that sends the Indian army to Sri Lanka is shown a few times * he has a receding hairline but is taller and leaner than the political personage that inevitably comes to mind. However, he is never named. The main Tamil rebel outfit that refuses to be disarmed ahead of a provincial council election is led by a man called Anna Bhaskaran, who looks uncannily like Velupillai Prabhakaran. Although Madras Cafe has not been shot on real Sri Lankan locations, the production design, the camerawork and the editing ensure that what unfolds on the screen never looks less than authentic. John Abraham, cast against type, throws all his weight behind the character of the R&amp;AW agent who loses more than he gains in the line of duty. As an actor, he comes up trumps. Nargis Fakhri, playing a journo who converses only English, strikes the right notes. Debutante Rashi Khanna makes an impact in a brief but significant appearance as the army man*s wife. The other characters that complete the canvas * sundry secret agents, soldiers, militants and bureaucrats * are all identifiable figures who look and sound like real people. Madras Cafe is not your average Bollywood thriller. It crackles with genuine energy and is marked by true empathy for humanity. It is an unqualified triumph.</Review>

He was right. Rarely come films that demand of you to go beyond that you have seen, that make you read up on the events showcased and discuss them at length. Lost between the text-book history and the current affairs is one event that scarred the nation and left a worldwide impact. The reason I say lost is because one always speaks of Independence, the many wars with Pakistan we have fought among various other historical events but how many times have you seen the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi being dealt with in detail?

Major Vikram Singh (John Abraham) heading RAW's covert operations lands in Sri Lanka to convince Anna Bhaskaran (Ajay Rathnam) to drop his rebellious stance against the peace accord between Sri Lanka and India. He must work with colleague Bala to get Anna Bhaskaran (Ajay Rathnam) who is the head of the rebel LTF group to accept a peaceful resolution. However, in the process Vikram unearths a deeper conspiracy against India. If not for a producer like John Abraham, Madras Cafe, a film devoid of any potboiler parameter, wouldn't have found its way to the cinema halls in such a big way. John Abraham, the producer had already laid down the fact with Vicky Donor that he is out to make films that make a difference and he only takes his thinking forward with an intelligence cinema like Madras Cafe that expects you to buck up and smarten up. Madras Cafe isn't a film you casually enter a cinema hall to watch. It is no Chennai Express which you can laugh off and forget the moment you are out of the cinema halls. Madras Cafe is pacy, involves historical events shown in a light you haven't seen before. There are way too many activities in the film and you cannot afford to miss even a single frame lest you want to go clueless about what happened how and when. Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar takes complete charge of the film. He researches like a R&amp;AW (Research and Analysis Wing) Agent himself and not just presents facts the way they have been stated out in the Jain Commission Report but weaves around a thriller that grips you from scene one. Sircar takes a Blood Diamond and Body Of Lies kind of story-telling approach and keeps the treatment of the film pretty much like the Hollywood films. This isn't to put it in the negative light for Madras Cafe with 130 minutes is smart and slick. The only problem in the narrative is the non linear approach which could easily be eliminated. It appears the filmmaker tries really hard to confuse the audience in a bid to add an extra thrill. Madras Cafe gets amply aided by the pitch perfect casting and the startling backdrop. Sircar's strength comes in the smart choice he takes of roping in fresh faces for pivotal parts. So you don't see a regular Bollywoodian character actor taking up the task of playing yet another character. The names like Siddharth Basu, Prakash Belawadi, Piyush Pandey, Ajay Rathnam add the much needed realistic feel to the film. It's either the improvement of John Abraham or the smart direction of the filmmaker that the actor appears surprisingly good in his part. Major credit goes to the character which literally appears tailor made for the superstar. Sircar goes cliche in roping in Nargis Fakhri, may be to add face value, to the character of a foreign journalist which could well be done by anybody else and probably a better actor than her. Debutant Raashi Khanna as John's wife in the film plays a better part than the one film old Nargis. Cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi and dialogues by Juhi Chaturvedi also deserve a mention for had it not been for the near perfect setting or the impactful dialogues the film wouldn't have made for a brilliant watch. To sum it up, Madras Cafe is a stupendous thriller and though it slips in some parts, the film is an overall winner. Cinema like this should be encouraged!</Review>

Political, tense, finally explosive, Madras Cafe is no picnic in the neighborhood park. Major Vikram Singh (Abraham) lands in Sri Lanka, heading RAW's covert operations. He must work with colleague Bala to get Anna Bhaskaran (Rathnam), head of the rebel LTF group - "Also known as Tigers" - to accept a peaceful resolution. Vikram knows Anna will be a huge challenge - what surprises him is how many others he must face. Best Reader's Review Madras Cafe dives boldly into terrain Bollywood hasn't touched before. Its arsenal features research, respect and bravely, no songs. But it's not arty or preachy anywhere. Its first half is layered, complex trails - leaks, foreign interests, domestic rivals - slowly revealed to Vikram. As RAW boss Robin Dutt (Basu) ups the pressure, Vikram must move fast through sultry, dangerous airs. His foreign journalist friend Jaya (Fakhri, apparently playing real-life journalist Anita Pratap, who first interviewed LTTE chief Prabhakaran) knows this conflict's heart even better than Vikram, whose discoveries, from Sri Lanka to South Block, grow traumatic. Madras Cafe's true star is its story which builds up to an agonizing end. It brings to life the Lankan war which many viewers were too young to have known. It highlights India's ambiguous role, moving sensitively, taking no sides, except those of relationships involving respect - but no romance - between Vikram and Jaya, duty, victory and loss. Its second half grows more fraught and taut, conspiracies and compulsions becoming clearer. John stays low-key and competent as Vikram while supporting actors, like agents Bala, SP and Vasu, stand out. Restrained performances by the LTF suicide bombers are chilling. The cinematography is remarkable, shots of huge naval warships, helicopters floating across hills, sunshine on a deadly sea, haunting. Commendably, Sircar never overindulges in gore, keeping Madras Cafe a shifting site of mental violence. Madras Cafe deserves an extra half-star for guts, going for the gunpowder - but with a restrained hand.</Review>

Getting embroiled into unwanted hullabaloo -- before or post release of the film -- is not what a film-maker would want to get into. But Shoojit Sircar, who attempted a film on Kashmir [YAHAAN] and followed it up with a film on sperm donation and infertility [VICKY DONOR], gets into the serious zone yet again with MADRAS CAFE. An espionage thriller that's set in India, Thailand, Singapore, U.K. and Sri Lanka. So why a title like MADRAS CAFE for a film that talks of the assassination of our former Prime Minister? Well, that's the cafe where the conspiracy was hatched, we're told. Okay, now let's move ahead... The Hindi movie spectator has often been subjected to stories that depict the conflict with Pakistan, but Shoojit attempts to narrate a story that not many from the present generation would know -- the civil war in Sri Lanka. What transpired in the 1980s and 1990s and how it impacted the political scenario of India has never been recreated in the Hindi film space. The conflict is diverse this time around and so is the territory. In short, enlightenment takes precedence over entertainment in this case. Final word? MADRAS CAFE is one of the finest thrillers to come out of India. No two opinions on that! An Indian Intelligence agent, Vikram [John Abraham], is assigned the task of going to Sri Lanka for a covert operation. As he embarks upon his journey, with the intention of disrupting a rebel group, he discovers the larger issue: A conspiracy to assassinate the former Indian Prime Minister. Shoojit Sircar takes a historical actuality and along with screenplay writers Somnath Dey and Shubendu Bhattacharya weaves a captivating and compelling screenplay around it. He handles the sensitive subject matter with supreme care, prudence and sensitivity -- without being biased or opinionated. He restructures the civil war in Sri Lanka with authenticity, portraying the rebels and diplomats and also depicting India's involvement in the conflict that had ramifications on India. As a matter of fact, the storyteller tries to be as neutral as possible while narrating the tale and that's what makes the effort so credible and convincing. Shoojit comes to the point at the very start [the opening sequence of the film prepares you about what to expect, frankly!], enveloping a number of incidents and episodes that transpired during the bygone era. The danger, the vulnerability, the helplessness, the role of the Indian government, the politics and the conspiracies... Shoojit transports you into that milieu and environment with conviction. The sequences that lead to the hair-raising finale and the impactful winding up astonishes you beyond words. What also needs to be highlighted is the fact that the Hindi movie spectator is used to a lot of spoon feeding, which discourages independent thought, but Shoojit abstains from indulging in it. The intention of the film-maker is very evident that the spectator form his/her own estimation, which seems most appropriate in this case. Additionally, Shoojit deserves brownie points for thinking beyond the stereotype, especially since he doesn't repeat himself after the immensely successful and likeable VICKY DONOR. The film is devoid of songs, except for the lone track that comes towards the conclusion, which is absolutely fine. The background score [Shantanu Moitra] is terrific. Shunning away from gravity-defying stunts, the action director also keeps the action as bona fide as possible. The DoP [Kamaljeet Negi] captures the ambiance and the picturesque locales splendidly. Dialogue [Juhi Chaturvedi] are intelligent, piercing and poignant. John Abraham has often been labelled a director's actor and Shoojit makes sure he doesn't let the actor's strong persona overpower the challenging opportunity of depicting a law protector. John too surrenders himself completely to the director's vision and though he doesn't play the conventional hero, he does make an earnest effort to look the part he's portraying. Post ROCKSTAR, Nargis Fakhri gets yet another stellar role [of a war correspondent] and I must add, she takes rapid strides as an actor. It's a treat watching Siddhartha Basu [as Robin Dutt] in a challenging role. He's fantastic. So is Dibang, who is damn impressive in a cameo. Prakash Belawadi [as Bala] is another actor who leaves a super impression. He's first-rate. Ajay Ratnam [as Anna] gives a good account of himself. Raashi Khanna is efficient as John's wife Ruby. Piyush Pandey is appropriate. Sanjay Gurbaxani as the former Prime Minister is apt. Kannan Arunachalam [as Shri] is perfect. On the whole, MADRAS CAFE is an earnest and honest effort, a terrific thriller, with several poignant moments and episodes that leave a stunning impact. It's a film that you should watch because it gives you an insight into an exceptionally pertinent episode of history. If you are in the frame of mind to watch superior quality, sensible cinema, I would strongly recommend MADRAS CAFE to you. Try not to miss it!</Review>

Akshay Kumar playing the all-powerful, Dawood-style, murderous mafia don Shoaib, declares: *Villain hoon main, villain.* He says it with such a menacing relish that I wanted to applaud. More than anything else in Milan Luthria*s related stories He chews up the scenery with his dangerous frown, flaring nostrils, dark glasses, flicked cigarettes and thunderous dialogue. Shoaib is gleefully evil. As he says: *Mujhe accha banne ka koi shauk nahin hai.* But the beauty is that underneath the swagger, Akshay also locates the loneliness and heartache of a monster hobbled by love. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed watching him this much. The rest of the film works in fits and starts. Like Milan*s earlier pictures * Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai and The Dirty Picture * Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara! is full-throttle masala. Situated some time in the 1980s, the film revels in blaring background music, old-school machismo, glaring loopholes in logic (starting with that strangely spelled Ay in the title) and, of course, reams of whistle-inducing dialogues by Rajat Aroraa, who also wrote those two earlier films. http://www.hindustantimes.com/Images/Popup/2013/8/17_08_13-metro14b.gif No one here just talks. Every dialogue is a declaration, saying or metaphor. At one point, Shoaib says something like *Jo doodh main nimbu daalta hai, paneer usi ka hai*. Some of the lines were so twisted that I couldn't even decipher the meaning behind the imagery. The pacing is bumpy * too many songs unnecessarily stretch the film to 160 minutes. The screenplay is clunky and for much of the first half, Imran Khan, who plays Shoaib*s prot? Aslam, is plainly out of his depth. Imran has a naturally sweet, vulnerable presence but the role requires drama and flamboyance. He makes for an awkward, hesitant gangster but becomes more convincing as the love story takes hold. What*s interesting is that this is a Mumbai mafia story but what drives it is the love triangle between Shoaib, Aslam and an actress * Jasmine * played nicely by Sonakshi Sinha. Yes, the film is over-wrought, melodramatic and designed as pulp fiction. But it*s intermittently fun. One of my favourite scenes was Shoaib going voluntarily to the police station.</Review>

The audience will guess early on that the most earnest cop in the unit is the traitor who's been leaking information to the bad guy. Or that the person who talks about living life to the fullest will be diagnosed with a fatal condition. Or that two best friends who swear never to let anything come between them will find their relationship tested. The characters on screen are always the last to know; they invariably figure out these things well after the audience does. It's an accepted fact in storytelling. Yet the three protagonists in 'Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara' aren't just na?, they're plain stupid. This disappointing sequel to 2010's Ajay Devgan-Emran Hashmi starrer is constructed around the premise of a love triangle...the laziest love triangle you could possibly imagine. Shoaib (Akshay Kumar) is a mob boss. Aslam (Imran Khan) is his loyal prot?. Both men develop feelings for struggling actress Jasmine (Sonakshi Sinha), who is close to Shoaib and Aslam. But Jasmin doesn't know that Shoaib is a don, or that Aslam works for him, or even that Shoaib has designs on her. Shoaib and Aslam, meanwhile, are unaware that they're both in love with the same girl. That's way too many clueless people in one film! The earlier installment, also directed by Milan Luthria, was nicely evocative of 70s nostalgia helped no doubt by Ajay Devgan's insouciant take on a dreaded gangster. Akshay Kumar, on the other hand, replaces Devgan's sexy nonchalance with in-your-face flamboyance. Dark glasses perched permanently on his nose, puffing away on a cigarette, Akshay swaggers into the frame as Shoaib, offering the promise of a deliciously unapologetic anti-hero. It doesn't help that writer Rajat Arora, as if to compensate for the flimsy plot, goes into overkill mode with wise-ass dialogues. Unlike the earlier film, which paid homage to the Salim-Javed era of memorable one-liners, this sequel is a full-fledged assault of rat-a-tat punch lines. When asked by a flunkie why he's recruited two young kids to join his gang, Shoaib responds: "Doodh mein nimboo jisne daala, paneer uski". On the changing face of the city, he says: "Yeh bambai, Kumkum se Kimi Katkar mein badal gayi hai", and on love he delivers this gem: "Pyaar aaj kal naukrani jaise ban gaya hai. Aata hai, bell bajata hai, kaam karke chala jaata hai." If the love triangle isn't particularly compelling, it's because it's hard to get to the real emotions of the characters, buried as they are beneath all that cockiness. Imran Khan as Aslam, ostensibly the hero of this film, appears ill at ease rolling those corny lines off his tongue, and resembling a rich urban kid slumming it out as a tapori at a dress-up party. Sonakshi Sinha's Jasmine has got to be the most pea-brained woman you've ever met. She happily lets Shoaib rig awards for her, and thinks it's cute when he turns up on her set and halts shooting. She hangs out with him at his home, takes lifts with him in his car, but claims to be outraged when he says he has feelings for her. Fresh off her terrific performance in Lootera, Sonakshi constructs a singularly contemptible character in Jasmine. Akshay Kumar, for all those sinister threats, ultimately turns Shoaib into a laughable clich?He goes on and on about being a villain, but we never see him get truly down and dirty. The film does have a few strong bits, including an inspired cameo by Sonali Bendre, and a clever scene in which Shoaib walks into a police station intending to surrender himself. But these are small mercies in a major misfire as this. Too long at over 150 minutes, and way too predictable to ever surprise you, Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara is the equivalent of getting a root canal. I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five. Call me cynical, call me a spoilt-sport, but don't call me if they decide to make Once Upon A Time in Mumbai 3!</Review>

It's the 1980s, you see, a period when it was perfectly normal to be born as Baby Guddu and grow up to become Rishi Kapoor (Nagina, anyone?). So if the intention is to recreate to the improbable sensibilities of that superficial space, Milan Luthria's Once Upon A Time In Mumbai Dobaara is appropriately iffy. It's also a complete drag, unintentionally comical and painfully verbose unlike the prequel which hit quite a few right notes with its slick take on the anti-hero against the half-hearted immorality of the 1970s. Rivalry makes way for romance in the follow-up but for a film set against the mafia, the predominant action is the yak yak coming out of Akshay Kumar's mouth. Though the actor, saddled with an absurd script against a gaudy set in a jaded love triangle, is a treat though conveying an extravagant personality and remorseless menace as the underworld kingpin, Shoaib. As the ultra glamorous style bhai in over-sized glasses and pointed collars/retro suits, AK smokes incessantly to the point the cautionary sign begins to seem like a permanent watermark against Ayananaka Bose's bright but banal looking frames. Unfortunately, despite's AK's glossy and gritty efforts to hold this 160 minutes of predictability, there's a spent vibe to OUATIMD. That 'designed for wolf-whistles' tone of Rajat Aroraa's dialoguebaazi tries too hard. The exchange, on many occasions, feels stilted and stuffy. Nobody talks in this film. Every one states. (No wonder one of the most impressive moments in the film is when Akshay simply walks in and out of a police station without anybody noticing.) Eventually this silly tribute to Salim-Javed and Kader Khan -- Machchar jiska khoon peeta hai ussi ke haathon marta hai -- gets flimsier than the wig on Mahesh Manjrekar's ballooned skull. It doesn't help that the only other agenda of OUATIMD besides Akshay Kumar and his book of quotations is a romance triangle involving his subordinate (Imran Khan) and an aspiring actress (Sonakshi Sinha). What primarily worked in the first one is the challenge and conflict Emraan Hashmi's defiant personality provided to Ajay Devgn's supremacy. But the sorely miscast Imran Khan fumbles in a role, which neither builds him up as a resilient Romeo nor showcases his spirit as a daring David up against the proverbial Goliath. For a seemingly significant member of an international criminal's gang, he's shown spending way too much time safeguarding his friend's romantic life. No amount of facial hair can wipe off the vanilla in Imran's essence. As for his chemistry with Sonakshi, the less said the better. Not because it's that bad but because there isn't any. In comparison, the comfort level between her and AK (her co-star of Rowdy Rathore, Joker) provides some amusement. What doesn't is her moronic logic of rejecting someone because he's a criminal and embracing another criminal to rescue her from the first one or that never-never-ending sequence in the hospital. It's disappointing to see her squander in Luthria's silly cash-in sequel so quickly after one of her best works (Lootera). When not seeped in implausibilities (and by that I don't just mean Imran Khan single-handedly taking on a man the size of two Rami Reddys), Luthria's OUATIMD is a crammed fare that wastes the lovely Sonali Bendre in a three-scenes role till it reaches its flat climax. In one scene, a character remarks how courage doesn't need legs to move ahead. Perhaps. But for a movie to get anywhere it needs to have more substance than the vacuous cigarette smoke coming out of Akshay Kumar's mouth.</Review>

Given that its director and writer are the same, I knew that the clunkily-titled-and-spelt Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! would tread the same territory: gangsters- muscle-flexing-in-Mumbai-which-used-to-be-Bombay, non-stop rat-a-tat of '70s style dialogue-baazi, loud background music, and a plot riddled with predictabilities from beginning to end. What I wasn't prepared for was just how similar it would be, despite the change in leads (Ajay Devgn and Emran Hashmi have been replaced by Akshay Kumar and Imran Khan, and instead of Kangna Ranaut, there is Sonakshi Sinha), and after a point, just how listless it would turn out to be. Hashmi's brash I want-to-take-over-everything Shoaib is played by Akshay Kumar in the new film. The character, fleshed out with nods to the dreaded Dawood (those distinctive dark glasses, and a penchant for cricket and betting) is first seen lording it over in what we presume is Dubai. Shoaib is ruthless and ambitious, and master of all he surveys, but `Bambai' calls to him because an underling (Manjrekar) who has dared to challenge him has to be set straight. Once in Bombay, he whistles up his faithful. One of them is Aslam (Khan), whom Shoaib had taken over when he (Aslam) and his best friend Dedh Tang (Tripathy) were youngsters. But before the script turns its attention to these `bhais' duking it out in Dongri (or wherever it is that they hang out in large numbers), it comes up with a romantic distraction for both the main gents. The spirited Jasmine (Sinha) is new to Bombay, and a wannabe heroine. She is also more na? than any young woman has the right to be. Unless, of course, she belongs to a film like this where logic is made to bow before masala and melodrama. Sinha does her by now all-too-familiar 'susheel'-sassy-sexy act, and swings like a magnet between Shoaib and Aslam, and here's where I have a quibble. Any self-respecting goody-two-shoes heroine like Jasmine locked into what used to be such a Hindi cinema staple*the triangle-- should make her interest clear. Why confuse us? You should see this wench making up to Shoaib, and then screaming: 'Par maine tumhe uss nazar se kabhi dekha nahin', or words to that effect. Really? Then what was she doing batting her eyelids at him? And she's a near-avuncular pal to Aslam before she gets all dewy all of a sudden. Such complexity in a lead actress of a movie like this is most unfair. I missed Ajay Devgn and Emran Hashmi of the original, who made credible 'bhais', and carried off those rhyming dialogues. Akshay Kumar lacks menace and quickens only when those glasses are off his face, which doesn't happen too often in the film . And his delivery is a drone, crackling strictly in a couple of moments. Imran is too clean-cut to be a goon, especially one that's meant to be grimy. Nice to see Sonali Bendre back, though, even if in a cameo: as Shoaib's wife/consort, she is looking weathered, and more interesting . After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?</Review>

This week, a film releases with a name that starts with those very words and then makes a mockery of them. Once Upon A Time In Mumbai Dobara is effectively, of course, Twice Upon A Time. Now, having walked out of this new Milan Luthria film, I wish they had gone with the Twice Upon title -- if only because of how convenient it would be to call it T.W.A.T: The Movie. The first Once Upon A Time In Mumbai was -- while not a good film by any stretch of the imagination -- a tolerable throwback to the dialogue-laden movies of yore. Things have gotten far worse this time around, with characters talking exclusively in the sort of aphoristic couplets found on auto-rickshaw stickers. Akshay Kumar makes some of those lines work, but the rest are beyond redemption. What is most upsetting is how the vital lines flounder the most: unrelated inanities pop up throughout, but it is when the script actually demands a line with some heft that there is none to be found. It is as if the writers copy-paste lines from railway station shayari books whenever they can, but at times of actual dramatic punch, nothing fits. Except, that is, Akshay Kumar. Kumar -- despite his preparation for this film consisting merely of picking out the right pair of sunglasses -- relishes playing villain. He says as much, too, in a rare good line about how the Hindi film hero only enjoys the final reel where things end happily while the baddie lives it up throughout the film. And so his Shoaib Bhai smokes and slithers and, for some reason, taps chairs repeatedly on the floor till he gets the attention of the room. A dreaded gangster, Shoaib is most impressed by those rare ones who stay impudent to his face -- even after learning that those folks have no idea who he is, and seeing them cower like everyone else when apprised of his omnipotence. One such character is the film's heroine, Jasmine, a thickheaded young actress with wide-eyes and a tendency to misconstrue most everything said to her. Sonakshi Sinha, who plays this exasperating actress, is quite wasted in this role -- playing dumb to comedic effect isn't up everyone's alley -- and a scene near the finale has her screeching like a possessed banshee. Why gangsters in our films fall for the most psychotic of women is, however, the story for another day. For now, a much more relevant question would be just what purpose Imran Khan serves in a movie like TWAT. Sure, Kumar's a bad guy and there needs to be a hero in a film this formulaic, and I get that this film is ostensibly a love triangle, but so entertaining is Kumar's swagger and so feebly does Khan deliver his lines that even if Khan's character were completely excised, it wouldn't hurt the movie an ounce. In fact, since it'd considerably trim the seemingly unending 160-minute running time, it'd be a massive plus. Shoaib is an all-powerful don who plagues Bombay with ease, getting rid of all who stand in his way. Imran Khan's Aslam, a youngster Shoaib scooped off the streets a dozen years ago, is one of his most trusted men. Somewhere down the line, however, both men committed to life without love fall for the same girl. Ta-da. The film is constantly predictable -- just like the first film in the series -- but leans too heavily on a very hackneyed romantic angle. It isn't often one gets to say this about a Bollywood actioner, but a few more gunshots could have been nice. Kumar more than makes up for the lack of Devgn, but despite having a similar first name, Imran really can't match up to Emraan. It is nice, however, to see Tiku Talsania and Sonali Bendre back on the big screen, albeit in small roles. (Though neither gets as inexplicably thankless an appearance as the lady from Luthria's Dirty Picture.) Also enjoyable are a Kapil Dev lookalike who clouts a cricket ball quite like the Haryana Hurricane used to (even though when this one hits it in the air it stays there for a few minutes before reaching the fielder), and, on a related note, the sight of the once-ubiquitous Rapidex English Speaking Course books. The rest is nonsense. No, worse: expensive nonsense. In the film's finest scene, when there is an all-points bulletin for Shoaib's arrest, the gangster, fed up by the police, strides defiantly into a police station and is... well, utterly ignored as he stands there and walks out again. Typical. We never quite knew what to do with our stars.</Review>

Stare at that for a moment and see if it makes sense on its own and then in context with the film. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. This mantra is entirely understandable from a producer's point-ofview, but one wonders how many identical looking films can a creative mind keep cranking out. Unlike in Hollywood, where a franchise is usually handed over to another director while the original creator moves on, our filmmakers are content repeating themselves for most part. So here we are again - Akshay Kumar taking over the mantle of Daw... Shoaib - and this time entangling himself in a love triangle with an airheaded Mand... Yasmin (Sonakshi Sinha who inadvertently doubles up as comic relief) and his trusted aide from Dongri, Aslam (Imran Khan miscast but trying his utmost). We see a lot of Shoaib's wealth and power, sanitised of all things evil. I won't go so far as calling this glorification of a criminal but even if we're to treat the film as pure fiction (as the makers insist we do) then we needed a better balance with the darkness that envelopes the character that is beyond his always-on black shades. The first film had some of this, but Dobaara is rather sanitised. The crux, the triangle, is ridiculously simplistic and depends far too much on trusted aides and girlfriends not sharing any information about their personal lives, rendering the premise unreal. All they share are wisecracks on mispronouncing English words, in-jokes and references that many young viewers will miss, and oneliners that are now the writer's trademark. To be fair though, Arora's writing is definitely a notch less hyperbole and an inch more realistic, a welcome break from every line being infused with metaphors and smugly uttered - complete with knowing pauses - by actors who have a remarkable foresight of audience reactions. Even Luthria's direction is more assured than his previous endeavors and he shows restrain in handling this mega-budget enterprise. There is more cohesiveness between the scenes and he manages some dramatic moments that keep you engaged. Little touches that shape the period it is set in go a long way. He is helped considerably by Ayananka Bose's excellent camerawork. Luthria also doesn't let his actors go over the top and keeps their performances limited to their strengths. Sometimes though, this backfires and the menacing Shoaib is simply Akshay Kumar. To sum up, Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara is a better crafted film than it's predecessor but unfortunately considerably shallower. It's style keeps you reasonably occupied but for a runtime of 160 minutes, it needed a lot more substance.</Review>

Make a sequel of it! Yes, that's sadly the ongoing culture in Bollywood and even some of the top filmmakers are giving in to the lure of encashing the fame earned in their previous hits irrespective whether those films deserve a sequel or not. Milan Luthria is one such filmmaker who teams up with for the third time, this time around with the sequel Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara (OUATIMD). We tell you whether this Independence Day deserves the holiday weekend hype or not.

Click to View All OUATIMD takes off from where the first part ended. Shoaib (Now Akshay Kumar) who killed his mentor in the past to gain supremacy repeats history as he, in a similar fashion of his mentor, picks up a nobody from the streets and teaches him the tricks of the trade. 12 years later, Shoaib is the ruling mafia king from Mumbai all the way till Arab (read Dubai) and the nobody Aslam (Imran Khan) one of his favourites in the convoy. Shoaib's quest to nail down his rival Rawal (Mahesh Manjrekar) brings him back to Bombay which is where he stumbles upon a young actress - Yasmin (Sonakshi Sinha). He is immediately taken in by her freshness, beauty and candor. Slowly, but surely his attraction towards Yasmin goes onto becoming an obsession. And little does his know that his own protegee Aslam will come in his way for the latter too takes an instant liking to Yasmin. This creates a rift between Shoaib and Aslam and results in the ultimate showdown between the mentor &amp; protegee. The first installment of this franchise had become an instant hit with the masses purely for the stellar casting, astounding dialogues and tremendous performances. One still cannot forget the suave swagger of Sultan Mirza played by Ajay Devgn or the uninhibited hunger for power of Shoib played by Emraan Hashmi in the film. However, call it over confidence of the filmmaker Milan Luthria who apparently banked completely on the success of the first part to pay any attention to the second or sheer laxity and laziness that OUATIMD turns out to be not even half as entertaining and interesting its predecessor. A few days after the launch of the sequel's first trailer, Luthria had launched its second promo citing that he received a lukewarm response for the first preview. Well, his insiders who actually gave him the buzz reports should've instead urged him to replace the entire film itself for throughout this looong 160 minute saga you see actors beating around the bush for no rhyme or reason. In a bid to give a romantic twist to a gangster plot, both writer Rajat Aroraa and Milan Luthria neither did justice to the gangster potboiler nor managed to bring out the conflict in romance and instead ended up with a highly uninspiring and unentertaining film which can lull you to sleep. While the story definitely doesn't offer anything to look forth to, the performances turn into major let downs as well. Akshay Kumar does a downright shallow depiction of the character immortalized by Emraan Hashmi and fails miserably in all attempts to infuse a suave shade to his persona. The ample dialoguebaazi, a few interesting but mostly all puerile only make matters worse for him as he mouths them in such repetitive tone and accent that you literally get tired of all the excess talking that this film involves. Sonakshi Sinha who impressed one and all with her performance in Lootera goes back to essaying a dumb character in a commercial film. The portions of Yasmin are so loosely written that you really do not know what the filmmaker actually tried projecting. Surprisingly, the best performance (or the best of the lot) comes from the least anticipated character Imran Khan. Being criticized for his lack of acting capabilities, Imran tries way too hard to impress the audience with his happy go lucky natured character and though he falls flat yet again, he still remains the best of the three lead protagonists. Who would've thought such a day will come too! Call it the shortcoming of the filmmaker itself once again that he fails to extract even some good music from the hit composer Pritam. Except for a song or two, OUATIMD fails to please the mass with some lilting numbers as well. Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara, in short, is one film that one wouldn't want to chance twice upon! Inane plot, force conflict and lazy writing can bore you to death. Take this time if you want undisturbed three hour long sleep in an air-conditioned hall.</Review>

Yet Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! falls well short of being quite as engaging as the film that it is a sequel to. The reason is pretty obvious: the characters that Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi fleshed out in Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai were infinitely more complex and nuanced. The survivor from the first installment is the protagonist of this film. He is now older, meaner and given to ways that are more ruthless than the ones he learnt on the way up. The coldblooded gangster, now played by Akshay Kumar, returns from an offshore location to reclaim his turf in the city of his birth. Shoaib makes a huge hoo-ha about the fact that he isn't a hero, but a villain. His philosophy is rudimentary: good guys go to heaven; bad guys experience the bliss of paradise on earth. His methods are heavy-handed, and he delivers forceful one-liners at the drop of a hat. Some of them do come off pretty well and are certain to draw applause from Akshay Kumar fans. The conventional villain, Rawal (Mahesh Manjrekar), Shoaib*s principal underworld opponent, is reduced to playing second fiddle. The younger mobster Aslam (Imran Khan), a pre-teen biker who was picked off the mean streets by the big-talking mafia don more than a decade ago and turned into a trusted lieutenant, has grown up swearing blind allegiance to his mentor. Trouble erupts when the two men fall in love with the same girl, Jasmine Sheikh (Sonakshi Sinha), a Kashmiri lass who has come down to Mumbai to act in the movies. Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! is equal parts a gangster flick and a love triangle. Two films for the price of one? Not quite, because neither half rises to any great heights in terms of drama. Rather sad, because there is a great deal in the film that is quite impressive, not the least among which is the fact that the storyline, despite the occasional flaccid passage, remains completely focused on the three principal characters. Many a Bollywood gangster drama tends to lose its way in a maze of empty bluster, item numbers and needless bust-ups and stunts. Director Milan Luthria makes it a point not to go down that path. He opts for a more restrained approach to the rivalry between two larger-than-life gangsters over a desirable ingenue, who walks into the crossfire without ever realizing how bad things are going to get for her. Stylishly mounted, Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! is shot in muted hues, which captures both the street-level dread and the soaring sparkle of 1980s Bombay with consistent sharpness. What robs the film of genuine traction is that the action seems to unfold in a disinfected bubble that is out of bounds for the urban realities of the era. Moreover, there is very little chemistry between Sonakshi and the two male leads. The only time sparks actually fly is when Jasmine and Aslam lie under a small rail bridge and watch the wheels of a running train as it races by, generating electro-magnetic flickers in the darkness. What makes matters worse is a overly sterilised narrative that presents every hint of passion between the girl and the two men only as flights of the febrile male imagination running riot to the accompaniment of *romantic* songs. One of the two men is unable to express his feelings for the girl until it is too late; the other propositions her with as much grace as a village yokel, hurling gifts, including a penthouse on the city*s highest skyscraper, at her. At no point in the story does one feel that the two rivals in love would care enough for the woman to actually put their long-nurtured bonding at stake and bay for each other*s blood. This is Akshay Kumar*s film all the way * he struts around with the cocky confidence that he owns every frame. Just a degree of moderation might have stood in better stead. It is for Imran Khan, who sheds his milksop lover-boy image and takes on a tougher guise for the second time in his career after Matru Ki Bijlee.., that this film could prove to be a breakthrough. He provides evidence that he can handle a wider range of roles than he is usually allowed to play. Sonakshi, too, is given generous play by the screenplay, and she measures up to the demands of the role. In the supporting cast, Sonali Bendre Behl in a special appearance and Pitobash as Aslam*s childhood pal Dedh Taang, stand out. For all its flaws, Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! isn't only for Akshay Kumar fans. This Independence Day weekend, feel free to catch this gangster drama that masquerades as a violent love story.</Review>

They still are. Whether the story is told in retro-rap, or with stylish designer double Dons, or with gloss-free rawness of realism. This endless 'lawless' love affair continues. In OUATIMD, a love triangle forms the bloodline of the story, replete with 'donnisms', molls with maal and an overkill of 'loaded' dialogues pe dialogues. After Shoaib (Akshay) vanquishes his own gang-guru (in the prequel), he becomes the reigning mafioso with his terror squad spreading far and wide. Of course, Mumbai city wrapped in glam, glory and blood-soaked crime files is still fancied by the bhais ("Samundar ke baad Mumbai Shoaib se jani jaati hai!"). Shoaib picks up young Aslam (Imran) from the chawls and takes him under his wing. Their 'bhaihood' is bullet-proof, only until years later when starlet Jasmine (Sonakshi) walks in and arrests Shoaib with her charm and gullibility. The rogue turns Romeo with obsession, but she's already Aslam's chosen 'item'. Suddenly, the dons drop their other deadly dhandas to deal with crimes of passion instead (unbelievable!). Milan Luthria captures the essence of the period, packed with characters living behind 'dark shades' with an even darker conscience. This is a love story of a gangsta, it does not reopen dons' crime diaries. The first part is more engaging; thereon, the sluggish pace lacks the same dum. The heavy-duty dialogues (Rajat Aroraa) punch drama in the story, though at times too overbearing. The background score (Pritam &amp; Anupam Amod) pitches in dramatically. This film has its moments, but it's not as compelling as the prequel. Akshay does the bhai act with flamboyance and mojo. He gets a chance to do what he does best - herogiri (albeit less menacing, more entertaining), with charisma and clap-trap dialoguebaazi. Imran looks too suave for the part, but eventually rolls up his sleeves to play a don with dil, performing well in emotional scenes. Sonakshi pulls off a dabangg act to stand strong between two daunting dons.</Review>
      <Review Id="69" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/597599" Affiliation="Bollywoodhungama.com" Date="15th August, 2013" Likes="894" Rating="2.5/5">The Hindi film industry's fascination with gangster films dates back to the 1970s. Ironically, this year has witnessed a plethora of gangster films invading our cineplexes, while a few of them were inspired by real-life characters as well. Additionally, the year also marks a substantial rise in sequels, since the original films have tremendous recall value. Milan Luthria's ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! takes off from where ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI concluded -- the struggle for power. But unlike most gangster movies, ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! takes the precarious route of narrating a love story, with two criminals falling in love with the same woman, besides focusing on the game of one-upmanship between gangsters and the power struggle being played in the lanes and streets of Mumbai. Does Milan Luthria's take on the underworld live up to the humungous expectations? Let's analyze... ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! narrates the story of an underworld don, Shoaib [Akshay Kumar]. His only confidantes are his best friend Javed [Sarfaraz Khan] and former lover Mumtaz [Sonali Bendre]. He notices Aslam [Imran Khan] and takes him under his wings. Gradually, Aslam becomes one of his trusted confidantes. Shoaib stumbles upon an aspiring actress Jasmine [Sonakshi Sinha]. Slowly, but surely, his attraction towards Jasmine goes on to becoming an obsession. This creates a rift between Shoaib and Aslam and results in the ultimate face-off between the mentor and protege. First things first! Milan Luthria, who replicated the bygone era in his last two films [ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI and THE DIRTY PICTURE] successfully, seems like a complete pro in recreating the long-gone decades with flourish. Right from the ambiance to the outfits to the dialogue the protagonists or the assorted characters deliver, everything mirrors the 1970s and 1980s with accuracy and aptitude. Unfortunately, the first hour doesn't cut ice, focusing on the mandatory light moments, songs and dramatic moments that seldom seize your attention. However, Milan and writer Rajat Aroraa make sure they reserve the best for the second hour, packing the film with heavy-duty drama and conflict that makes it captivating and engaging. Also, Milan doesn't resort to action and bloodshed -- the key aspects that are inevitable for any gangster film -- to carry the story frontward. These elements, although part of the narrative, are used as garnishing wherever essential. In a way, Milan attempts a gangster film, but steers clear of factors that could eclipse the love story, drama and conflict in the narrative. Like I pointed out earlier, while the prequel held the spectators by its ears and eyes, ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! suffers because the grip is absent from the very start itself [which was the highpoint of the prequel]. Also, the villain [Mahesh Manjrekar] is just not authoritative or commanding enough here. But the writer springs a surprise by making the don [Akshay] vicious and vindictive towards the latter half, which adds a lot of weight to the proceedings. The final moments, starting with the fiery confrontation involving Akshay and Sonakshi, when she mistakes his friendship for love, right till the closing stages of the film, the graph of the film only soars upwards. Milan gets ample support from the DoP [Ayananka Bose; top notch] as well as the art department [well done, yet again!] to impart his vision on screen. The styling is unflawed, while the background score enlivens the ambiance at numerous junctures. The high point, of course, is the dialogue penned by Rajat Aroraa, which contributed enormously to the last two films and makes a significant contribution this time too. The conversations are compelling, forceful and power-packed. Pritam's music is in sync with the mood of the film. 'Yeh Tune Kya Kiya' and 'Tayyab Ali' [from AMAR AKBAR ANTHONY] are noteworthy compositions. Milan is a connoisseur who extracts proficient performances from his actors and this is apparent in ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! as well. Akshay enacts the grey character with flourish. He adds a lot of novelty and uniqueness to his character, underplaying it magnificently and modulating his voice dexterously. After playing urban characters in his earlier films, Imran plays a desi character [his second this year!] this time, catching you by complete surprise yet again. It won't be erroneous to state that he's the dark horse. Sonakshi seems to be improving with every film. Besides exuding the right amount of innocence, she goes on to demonstrate that she can handle emotional outbursts really well, especially during the climax confrontation with Akshay. Sonali Bendre Behl doesn't get much scope, but shines in the powerful sequence with Akshay. Sophie Choudhry sizzles in a cameo. Sarfaraz Khan does well. Mahesh Manjrekar is wasted. Ditto for Abhimanyu Singh, who doesn't get much scope. Pitobash, Hussain Shaikh, Mushtaq Khan and Chetan Hansraj are alright. On the whole, ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! has a powerful second half and the drama/conflict helps the film regain ground, after a shaky first hour. However, the fact cannot be denied that ONCE UPON AY TIME IN MUMBAI DOBAARA! pales in comparison to its prequel.</Review>

Hunny and Choocha, played by Pulkit Samrat and debutant Varun Sharma are buddies whose only aspiration is to get into the coolest college in town. Zafar, played by Ali Fazal, is a struggling musician and Lali, played by Manjot Singh, is the hapless son of a halwai who watches his girl, who already attends the cool college, get enamored by big cars and slick guys. Lali, Hunny and Choocha desperately want to get into the college (Hunny and Choocha fantasize about riding in on horses) but none have the grades. The leaked exam papers cost Rs. 50,000 each. And so begins a journey that takes them to the wily college watchman Punditji, played by the terrific Pankaj Tripathi and Bholi Punjaban played by Richa Chadda, the local mistress of vices. Director Mrighdeep Singh Lamba gives us a theatre of the absurd set in East Delhi. The characters and actors are a perfect match. Pulkit embodies the over-confident charmer and Manjot looks comically sweet and bewildered all the time. But my favourite was Varun as the foolish and always-in-heat Choocha whose dreams kick-start the entire mess * he manages to be both, idiotic and endearing. Ram Sampath*s boisterous score add to the rough and tumble feel of the film. But the problem with Fukrey is that the characters and milieu are more engaging than the plot, which gets more far-fetched as it thickens. By the time we get to a rave party and drugs, the outrageousness of the story becomes exhausting. By the climax, the writing becomes slack. Anything is possible, including a financial windfall from a character who seems tacked on to save the day. But there is enough pep in Fukrey to make it pleasantly diverting. I*m not suggesting that you drop everything and get to the theatre. But if you happen to stroll in, you are likely to come out smiling.</Review>

But when things go wrong, as they inevitably do, they must pay the price for it. That familiar premise gets a fresh coat of paint in 'Fukrey', with co-writer and director Mrighdeep Singh Lamba putting a new spin on some old clich? Yet, while individual scenes inspire laughs, the film doesn't quite fly because there are too many gags and not enough plot. Hunny (Pulkit Samrat) and Choocha (Varun Sharma) badly want to get into college so they can ditch classes and ogle girls. Lali (Manjot Singh) is fed up of working at his father's eatery, desperate to "migrate" from his correspondence course to a campus. Meanwhile, brooding musician Zafar (Ali Fazal) sports a guitar and a permanently sad face, with neither aspirations nor inspiration in sight. They're interesting protagonists, but the makers invest too heavily in them and not enough in the story, taking almost an hour before introducing the film's most delicious character, a tough-talking crime boss in high heels, Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadda), who bankrolls the boys' harebrained plan to crack an underground lottery. Unlike the far superior 'Delhi Belly', the writing in 'Fukrey' is never consistent. There are laughs to be had in the verbal sparring between Hunny and Choocha, and a running joke involving Lali being robbed each time he parks outside a gurdwara is sheer genius. Although many scenes work on the strength of sharp dialogue and spot-on performances, they don't always fit cohesively in the film's narrative thread. The solemn interludes with Zafar stick out like a sore thumb, and the anti-drug message in the end is just pat. Similarly, Hunny's romantic track with a simple girl from the neighborhood feels gratuitous at best. A tighter script and more screen time for the excellent Pankaj Tripathi, as enterprising campus security guard Pandeyji, might have helped turn this moderately entertaining film into a rollicking good caper. I'm going with two-and-a-half out of five.</Review>

All of which comes down to the first point namely a) save their skins. This may be a new film, but it is certainly not madly novel. Delhi Belly had the same idea with the addition of some excrement and expletives, minus one fukra. Also minus the fun, because this combo of Dilli slackers-using very Dilli slang-doing very Dilli things already feels like a template. Honey, Choocha and Lalli (Pulkit, Varun, Manjot respectively) are penniless, but that doesn't stop them from rolling the dice to see what's on the other side. Quite literally, as far as the first two go: the well-named Honey and Choocha (these names are very Dilli, very Punjabi) use betting as a sure-shot way to get past their 'phokat jeb' (no money in pocket status). These two are joined by two more. Zafar (Ali), who is the only one amongst the foursome that has a specific talent (he is a struggling musician), and Lalli, who has to get into the college of his choice to 'impress' a girl. That last bit of information would have felt like a spoiler in a more deftly executed film, even if it had a familiar storyline. But given that Fukrey feels so blah most of the time, it really doesn't matter. Each of these guys has a love interest, and some time and effort have gone into establishing their romantic tracks, but it mostly comes off as much too familiar. Manjot Singh, the young boy in Oye Lucky Lucky Oye, has a few nice moments. So does Varun Sharma (Choocha is a great moniker). But the rest are plain inert, including the female goon played by Richa Chadda. Her lingo is as colourful and crude as befits her occupation, but how many times can you see someone sneer and mention the rear end of the male body as the part that she will tenderly minister to, if her money is not returned? Chadda is as faux as her part. There are momentary diversions in the shape of the girls (Anand, Singh), but they don't add much to the proceedings. And how many times can we see fumbling fellows with cops hot on their heels running down the narrow alleyways of Old Delhi?</Review>
      <Review Id="73" Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Expected="" Link="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/fukrey-review/1/280219.html" Affiliation="Indiatoday" Date="14th June, 2013" Likes="14" Rating="2.5/5">The trailers were the best part of this film, to repeat an old cliche. Mrigdeep Singh Lamba, returning as director after the messed-up 3 Thay Bhai, gives us a Dilliwaala film this time, and sets out looking for humour in the college campus. He tries creating comedy in confusion, he ends up serving confusion in comedy. Fukrey caters the standard package of bromance that has been hot among Bolly buffs. Dil Chahta Hai, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Kai Po Che and Chashme Baddoor have set a pattern, and Lamba too tries out the buddy bonding formula in an energetic, youthful package. It looked wild in the promos. Not the same can be said of the film itself. Fukrey would have worked better if the screenplay revealed more imagination. This is the story of four friends who want admission in the coolest college in town after class XII. The assortment is typically Bollywood as far as societal representation goes. Hunny (Pulkit Samrat), Lalli (Manjot Singh), Zafar (Ali Fazal) and Choocha (Varun Sharma) make for a varied mix of class and religions. Notably, barring Manjot as Lalli (presumably the youngest actor of the group), the three others don't quite look their parts as young college-goers. The four friends, fukreys all, need cash all the time. So they indulge in betting and lottery. Their bets are based on decoding what one of them dreams. Twist in the tale comes when they lose sizeable moolah while gambling. They had taken the sum on loan from Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadda), a hard-cussing lady don who divides her interest between pimping and drug-peddling. The fukra foursome is now at its wit's end, hounded by Bholi on one side and in the radar of the cops on the other. Most of the early hour unfolds at a snail's pace with not much story to tell. The standard filmy campus scenario is in place with girls, gaana and familiar gags. Yaari-dosti snapshots and the usual dose on youthful dreams also fill up screen space. Director Lamba has a thing for loud humour, evidenced in his first film 3 Thay Bhai. Fukrey, set in Delhi, gives ample scope to play to the gallery with his brand of comedy. The problem is this film can't seem to decide what flavour of humour it exactly wants to peddle. The mood swings from boisterous to banal and there are few genuine laughs. The four greenhorn leads make a spirited whole that primarily drives this film. The scene stealer though is Richa's Bholi Punbjaban. She drives black humour with her body language, smoothly mixing the impact with a sinister edge. Look at the bright side. Fukrey reminds you that Bollywood these days is trying to entertain beyond tested flavours. The effort may have stumbled in execution. At least, like the four fukreys, the makers did try hard.

      <Review Id="74" Name="Karan Anshuman" Expected="" Link="http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Film-review-Fukrey/articleshow/20589050.cms" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="14th June, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">Fukrey is a smartly directed light comedy of four loafers - Hunny, Choocha, Lali, and Zafar - with modest ambitions. Nonetheless the screenplay of Fukrey is quite ambitious because each of the four characters is shaped from scratch and there is a lot to cram. You get to know of all their dreams, their backgrounds, and significantly, their love interests. However, these are merely asides and secondary to the main plot. They aren't even friends to begin with and the course of the story brings them together as they hatch their preposterous plan that will earn them enough to fulfill their goals: getting into college for the women and the general perks of the college life (only Zafar has a more serious, if cliched and out of place issue of an ailing father that rather sticks out). While the film takes its time to let all this information filter in, it receives major oomph with the appearance of Richa Chadha who, as Bholi Punjaban, seizes the reins and quickens pulses and pace. There's a lot to like in Fukrey. It sticks to the subtle and shies away from the tomfoolery and slapstick you've come to expect in films of the genre. It gives you an almost absurd Delhi-based love story that relies merely on stolen looks and notes exchanged across terraces on kites. In fact, it presents Delhi unpretentiously and one can tell that the details have a lived-in quality about them, the sort that Khosla ka Ghosla had. The writing often jumps time, leaving the audience lagging and playing catch-up. This isn't always a bad thing in times of spoon-feeding viewers. Ram Sampath's music is catchy but comes in spurts, making you long for more. Some of the film's transitions are outstanding, the mark of a good director. However, a few shortcomings keep Fukrey from hitting the bullseye. The crises in the love stories are unconvincing and easily overcome as is the big hurdle in the climax. Talk and chance solve the boys' problem not the adrenaline-inducing thrills one was expecting. This is a case of the film staying the course of its intention, but the ending underwhelms. Logic too, is on shaky ground in key moments. Debutant Varun Sharma is the pick of the Fukras given his bumbling, always-in-love, author-backed role. Pulkit Samrat reinvents himself after Bittoo Boss and pulls off a performance that promises great range from the actor. Producers Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar, take a chance on director Mrigdeep Singh Lamba's understated vision, backing him with the expertise that comes from making some of Bollywood's biggest and most loved movies. Not to forget they have a particular penchant for buddy films such as Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Na Dobara. Fukrey captures a similar spirit, albeit in a very different flavor and the small film experiment about life's trivialities manages to entertain for most part.</Review>
      <Review Id="75" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/fukrey-movie-review-826" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="13th June, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="3/5">There is something hugely infectious about the exuberance of youth. That is probably why Fukrey, a comedy about four Delhi boys in a tearing hurry to realise their little dreams against all odds, appears to exude much greater energy than it intrinsically possesses. While the bubbly air of eccentricity that underlines the script is endearing for the most part, it tends to get trapped in a repetitive loop at times. But, in the end, its meanderings do not last long enough to mar the fun beyond salvation. Comparisons, though odious, are inevitable. Fukrey is unlikely to hold up too well against similar buddy-buddy flicks that Bollywood has churned out in recent times with such frequency that they have now begun to feel like rip-offs of each other, barring a minor tweak here and a little twist there. Fukrey has neither the don't-care-a-fig irreverence of Delhi Belly nor the metro-sexual chutzpah of Dil Chahta Hai (which, of course, was the first film from the stable that has produced Fukrey). And if you are looking for an authentic worm*s eye view of Delhi lowlife, Fukrey isn't quite Oye Lucky Lucky Oye. But that is not to say it isn't an enjoyable film. It is. Many of its punch lines are quite funny, and some of the desperate measures that the quartet is compelled to take recourse to in order to wriggle out of sticky situations border on the uproarious. All that the quartet succeeds in doing is dig an enormous hole that gets bigger and darker with each misadventure they plunge into, adding to the mirth. Fukrey kicks off with two school back-benchers who are as thick as thieves, Vikas Gulati alia Hunny (Pulkit Samrat) and Dilip Singh alias Choocha. (debutant Varun Sharma). Their urge to go to one particular college in town and date the girls there is so great that they are willing to take any risk in the bargain. The bumbling Choocha has a dream every night. He narrates it to Hunny the next morning. The latter interprets the reverie and comes up with a number and a lottery to put his money on. What they make from the gamble sees them through the rest of the day. The duo befriends Lali (Manjot Singh), the son of a sweetmeat dealer. The latter is in the same boat. A first year correspondence course student, he too wants to enroll in the aforementioned college for a similar reason * his girlfriend studies there. The quartet is completed by a slightly older bloke, Zafar (Ali Afzal), son of a butcher who has traded the meat-cleaver for a guitar. He whiles away his time on the college campus as he waits for the two things he cares for * the girl he loves, the accountancy teacher Neetu Singh (Vishakha Singh), and the elusive big break as a musician. Fukrey, which is director and co-writer Mrighdeep Singh Lamba*s sophomore effort, would have been an infinitely better film if only it had a more focussed screenplay (co-written by Vipul Vig). The film is replete with the lingo of Delhi*s streets and college campuses and the four young actors do a fair job of ensuring consistent authenticity of diction. But despite the many shots of different parts of the city, including the unavoidable back lanes of old Delhi, Fukrey does not add up to a vivid portrait of the metropolis. But there is much in Fukrey that is likeable. It isn't a formula film, so it steers well clear of the conventions of a boy-meets-girl flick. Moreover, it does not succumb to the temptation projecting the female characters as mere objects of desire. Fukrey is a film about male bonding, but the actresses are given just about enough to do not to be completely overshadowed. Richa Chadha, in the guise of a tough-talking female don Bholi Punjaban, steps in as an ally-turned-adversary of the foursome as they hatch a daring plot to get rich quick. Vishakha Singh (who incidentally is also in the other release of the week) gets a few scenes that allow her to make her presence felt in no uncertain terms. Fukrey, at two hours plus, is in danger at times of overstaying its welcome. But the audience remains involved all the way through owing primarily to the endearing quality that the four young male actors bring to the table. The four boys are distinguished from each other by their individual traits * Hunny is a quick thinker, Choocha is hopelessly gullible, Lali is laidback and Zafar is reticent. Especially noteworthy is Manjot Singh as Lali, who tosses off one-liners with a straight face. Pulkit Samrat and Varun Sharma, too, pull their weight. However, Ali Fazal, saddled with a somewhat underwritten role, is left a bit in the shade. Richa Chadha plays for big laughs and gets them. Priya Anand (last seen in English Vinglish), despite the limited opportunities she gets, does not get swamped out of the picture. Fukrey is full-on entertainment although it stops shy of being an outstanding comedy. But the fact that it gets tantalisingly close is no mean feat. For all its flaws, it*s definitely worth a watch.</Review>

In fact, the four young protagonists stay pretty much out-of-class, out-of-money and out of ladki-luck too. Introducing the faltu foursome. Hunny (Pulkit) is the one blessed with some grey matter (never mind that he failed the first grade, and twice after). Choocha (Varun), is blessed with sona and sapna (these aren't his women). He sees weird dreams that only buddy Hunny can decode, so they crack a lottery number and win a jackpot (sone pe suhaga!). Lali (Manjot) comes with a big-heart `and a riotous sardar-sense-of-humour. The boys have a simple dream - to get a backdoor entry into one of the coolest colleges (with the hottest chicks) in Delhi. The fourth, Zafar (Ali) is an aspiring musician, with nothing but a G-string (read: guitar) and three loser boys for hope. Enter, the boisterous Bholi Punjaban (Richa) with nothing holy or bholi about her, really. She pimps, sells drugs and spews gaalis (maa, behen et al) galore. Bholi invests in the 'smart sapna scheme', but all goes kaput and the boys wake up to insanity and reality. Manjot's knack for poker-faced comedy is commendable. Debutant Varun is a surprise package; he steals the show with his spontaneity and uproarious antics. Pulkit pulls off the smart-ass act with confidence, Ali stays sober throughout. Richa is feisty and fires gallons of gaalis with aplomb. Priya and Vishaka breeze through their bits. Mrighdeep infuses comedy throughout, subtle and fresh. The humour is finely spun in the writing and dialogues (Mrighdeep, Vipul Vig). There's levity in the language and some hilarious moments. The first-half is slow-paced, but it rips riot soon. The story has newness, but at times it lacks the chaotic craziness that such a comic premise can unfold. Yet, the laughs are many to keep you entertained. So what the 'fuk-rey', go, crack up on your seats.</Review>

So when you see four lesser known newcomers put together in a madcap comedy you cannot brush the film aside as a lackluster attempt. There's definitely more, assures the name of Excel Entertainment tagged to it. So this Friday we make it easy for you to choose Fukrey as the film to watch. Fukrey starts off with two thick pals Hunny (Pulkit Samrat) and Dileep Singh aka Choocha (Varun Sharma) who want nothing more in life than to squeeze their way into the city's hippest college merely to woo the sexy college babes. But clearly not being the brightest of the students, their only hope to get in is through some jugaad. They are joined by Lali (Manjot Singh) a sardar with a big heart and small brains and Zafar (Ali Faisal), an aspiring musician with nothing but a guitar to himself. Together the four find their dreams coming true through Choocha's persistent whacky dreams that only Hunny can decode. Their game plan calls for heavy investments and through Zafar's contacts they approach Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadda), an expletives spewing gundi who can go to all lengths for money. They convince Bholi to invest in their rock-solid plan but things go awry soon after and the female gangster goes after their throats. Filmmaker Mrigdeep Singh Lamba who showed no talent in his easily forgettable debut Teen Thay Bhai makes a powerful return as he packs a punch with this comedy. For long comedy has only translated to brainless slapstick genre but who would've thought there'd come such an enjoyable change? Mrigdeep makes this possible as he takes a highly imaginative plot, fuses ample gags with witty writing and takes you on a joy ride with him. The film relies strongly on the exceptionally innovative and entertaining writing of Vipul Vig and Mrigdeep who don't fail at all in leaving you in splits. Though their writing suffers a little in the predictable romantic track Mrigdeep covers it up with his refreshing treatment to it. A major part of the credit also goes to the four actors Pulkit Samrat, Varun Sharma, Manjot Singh and Ali Faisal who, despite their limited experience bring to celluloid a highly enjoyable bromance. Richa Chadda who wooed the masses with her stark performance in Gangs Of Wasseypur brings about a pleasant change with her character that's menacing yet entertaining at the same time. It's also a refreshing change to see a female as a don, a field usually depicted by males in Hindi films. Priya Anand who was last seen in English Vinglish and Vishakha Singh do not get much scope to performance in this boy centric film but are decent in their bit roles too. To sum it up, Fukrey may not be a Rock On!! or Dil Chahta Hai but the new-age relatable bromance and humour that has you in splits all the time makes it for a great watch.</Review>

Additionally, films like 3 IDIOTS and KAI PO CHE! explored bromance and bonding amongst friends with utmost sensitivity. FUKREY, directed by Mrighdeep Singh Lamba, also falls in the same space, yet is different from the aforementioned movies. This one's a light-hearted, wacky fare that throws four youngsters in hazardous conditions, but, at heart, remains a fun and joyous ride. FUKREY mirrors the mindset of the youth of today who look for shortcuts to raise funds and attain their targets/dreams. However, unlike the aforesaid movies, this one makes no political statement, nor does it tackle larger than life issues. Although the premise/subject material may give an impression that it's a serious fare, the director and writers Vipul Vig and Mrighdeep Singh Lamba strike a fine balance between solemn and humorous. Frankly, the objective is to keep the spectator amused and FUKREY succeeds in this endeavor largely! FUKREY is about four youngsters and their tryst to make it big in life. Choocha [Varun Sharma] gets dreams, which Hunny [Pulkit Samrat] construes and decodes into a lottery ticket number. With the motive of acquiring the examination papers in advance, the duo decides to invest more money and reap benefits. Meanwhile, Lali [Manjot Singh] and Zafar [Ali Fazal] too need to fulfill their individual desires and aspirations and join hands with Hunny and Choocha. However, things go topsy-turvy when they pick up a loan from Bholi Punjaban [Richa Chadda], a female gangster... Post KHOSLA KA GHOSLA!, OYE LUCKY! LUCKY OYE!, DO DOONI CHAAR, DELHI BELLY, BAND BAAJA BAARAAT and VICKY DONOR, there is a barrage of films set in North India. But the similarity ends there. Like I pointed out at the outset, FUKREY is more about the Gen X who are keen to make it big via shortcuts and how they get entangled in a tight spot. The writers borrow from slice of life situations and throw the four characters in circumstances that may seem serious, but the spectator remains thoroughly amused by the goings-on. Additionally, the film stays true to Delhi's colloquialism, but the lines and speech are such that the film caters to a universal audience. Also, the humor is subtle and understated and not in your face tomfoolery and clowning. The best thing about FUKREY is its casting and by zeroing on relative newcomers for the principal leads, the makers steer clear of the baggage of image that reputable actors, generally, cart on their shoulders. Besides, FUKREY comes across as a renaissance for Mrighdeep, who faltered in his directorial debut TEEN THAY BHAI. This time, the screenplay moves fast and furiously, the escapades are wild and wacky and the pacing is just right. In fact, the writing is the biggest strength of the enterprise. Dialogue are witty and mirthful. The sole problem with FUKREY is that the narrative appears lengthened towards the concluding stages. A crisper culmination would've only facilitated in creating a stronger impact. As a matter of fact, the entire episode of raising the finance, right up to the guys settling the score with the female gangster, could've been swifter and even more compelling. Ram Sampat's soundtrack is in sync with the mood of the film. 'Fuk Fuk Fukrey', 'Jugaad Karle' and 'Ambarsariya' are notable compositions. The DoP captures the environs of old Delhi charmingly. Dialogue are amusing and augment the fun quotient. It would be unfair to state that FUKREY belongs to any one actor. Pulkit, Manjot, Ali and Varun, each of them gets ample scope to shine in their respective parts. Pulkit is confidence personified. He has the potential to make it big. Manjot is getting better with every film. He's top notch. Ali, last seen in ALWAYS KABHI KABHI, is earnest to the core. First-rate. Varun springs the biggest surprise. He contributes enormously to the laugh-out-loud moments. Richa Chadda is in terrific form and from her introduction itself, the graph of the film steers Northwards. Vishakha Singh is in super form. Priya Anand is wonderful and the scenes with Pulkit win you over. Pankaj Tripathi is, as always, fantastic. On the whole, FUKREY is a twisted and delectably uproarious take on the shortcuts the youth of today indulge in. Watch it for the sheer novelty and uniqueness it lays on display.

I was really pumped to see Go Goa Gone. Writer-directors Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK deliver what their zany promos promised, but only for half the film. Post-interval, the film does a zombie on us * it becomes dead, lumbering and tedious. But the first part is absolutely crackling. Our heroes are two deadbeat stoners * Hardik and Luv, played nicely by Kunal Khemu and Vir Das. These losers are so lazy that they argue for several minutes about who will pick up the remote to change the television channel. The third friend Bunny, played by Anand Tiwary, is a nerdy conscientious type, who seems perpetually traumatized by the other two. Hardik loses his job. Luv loses his girlfriend. All three end up at a rave party in Goa. The drugs being imbibed here are so powerful that they turn takers into zombies. Enter Boris, the Russian mafioso played by Saif Ali Khan, who throws the rave, supplies the drugs and then, of course, kills dead people. Raj, DK and their team of writers keep the gags coming thick and fast. The jokes are twisted, irreverent and very funny * there were several moments in which I laughed out loud. And then abruptly, the energy deflates like air out a balloon. Once the situation has been set up, the directors seem to run out of ideas. The plot circles on itself. The group keeps getting attacked by zombies and they keep figuring out ways to escape. At one point, Luv suggests impersonating zombies * an idea taken from Edgar Wright*s superbly funny zombie movie Shaun of the Dead. But Raj and DK are too clever to steal so Luv mumbles something like: kisi film mein dekha tha. I think the trouble with Go Goa Gone is too much cleverness and not enough plot. Post-interval, even the fabulous Boris, a tattooed, blond Russian rockstar from Delhi, starts to feel limp. Which is such a shame * because until then, Go Goa Gone is a gloriously trippy ride.</Review>

The film, starring Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, and Anand Tiwari as three best friends stranded on an island infested with flesh-eating zombies, works like magic when directors Krishna DK and Raj Nidimoru focus on their three leads and the irreverent banter between them. But, working off a slim plot, the filmmakers don't really know where to take the story after a point, and end up turning the film's entire second half into a lazy cat-and-mouse chase between man and monster. Channeling an unfiltered, sexually charged humor reminiscent of 'Delhi Belly', the film introduces us to permanently stoned Hardik (Khemu) and Luv (Das), who never leave their couch unless they absolutely have to. Stuck in jobs they have no interest in, their love and sex lives going nowhere, the two fellas decide to tag along when their straight-arrow roommate, Bunny (Tiwari), heads to Goa on a work assignment. The morning after a rave at a nearby island, an exclusive Russian drug that our heroes were too broke to buy has turned most partygoers into the walking dead. Along with a pretty girl, Luna (Puja Gupta), who also escaped the infection, the boys scramble around the island dodging the zombies until they run into Boris (Saif Ali Khan), a bleached-blond mafioso who claims he "kills dead people". The jokes fly thick and fast, particularly in the early scenes that benefit from a winning cocktail of laugh-out-loud dialogue and well-timed performances by the three leads. In one terrific sequence, they're attacked by a trio of female flesh-eaters. After bickering over who will tackle the hot one, and who must vanquish the fat one, the boys use everything from logs to umbrellas to whack, stab, and punch the daylights out of the women. Never have I laughed this hard at a sight so politically incorrect, yet so oddly funny. Saif Ali Khan as Boris, alternating between a Dilli accent and a Russian accent, is in very good form. In a scene where he interrogates and intimidates Kunal Khemu's character while checking for possible signs of the zombie virus, both actors shine as they play off each other. Khemu, in fact, has a rakish charm, and he plays the cocksure Hardik with a winning confidence. Vir Das as the goofy Luv, and Anand Tiwari as the earnest Bunny, hit all the right notes, seldom setting a foot out of place. It's a pity then the writers don't know what to do with these characters post intermission. So they're relentlessly pursued by swarms of zombies through forests and beaches and an abandoned home. Because these monsters inspire neither fear nor laughs, the film's extended climax doesn't feel merely convenient, but also wholly underwhelming. I'm going with three out of five for 'Go Goa Gone'. So much in this film is good, until it all goes nowhere in the end.</Review>
      <Review Id="81" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/movie-review-go-goa-gone/1114060/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="10th May, 2013" Likes="15" Rating="2/5">Three friends head to Goa for some fun and frolic. What they think will be non-stop party-time turns into a nightmare, as they run into an unending stream of strange, shuffling creatures, neither dead nor alive, thirsty for human blood. What are these, quavers one of the alive-but-shaken threesome. Not chudails, not bhoots, but, ta da, zombies. Hardik, Luv, Bunny (Khemu, Das, Tiwari) wouldn't have sounded so surprised if they had known that the venerable Ramsay Bros were the creators of India's first movie zombies. But there's one crucial difference between those and these: Go Goa Gone aims to make us laugh, and as we know, all laughter in the Ramsay horror shows was meant to be entirely unintentional. And that's certainly a first. Raj and DK's freshly-minted critters can safely take their place at the head of new-age Bollywood's blood-thirsty undead pantheon. Fittingly, Bollywood's first zom com (zombie comedy) borrows broad brushstrokes from this very Hollywood genre, not the least of which are the zombies, with their blank eyes, staggering walk, and blood-spattered teeth. That the setting is Goa, whose beaches are over-run with unwashed, stringy-haired, glassy-eyed foreigners, helps. Raj and DK cleverly use the desi Goa rave party as the most appropriate site for zombies: the raves are meant to be those drugged-out crazy parties filled with acid heads dancing to pot-fuelled trance, and we can easily imagine how these things could turn into hell. The fun stems from the interaction among the three guys, even though the trio itself comprises familiar types: one horny jackass, one lovelorn dweeb, and the third the straight, let-me-outa-here working stiff. The moment you hear one of them is called Hardik, you know that what the joke will be. The lines are sassy and smart up to a point, and then start sounding forced. But these three carry it off, even when the hilarity wears off. The mandatory girl (Gupta) fills up the line without fuss. And with Saif Ali Khan's arrival, in golden wig, dark shades and a god-awful faux Russian accent, the mandatory star turn is also in place. The film would have been funnier if the second act hadn't gone into a slide. And also if Khan hadn't played Boris (pronounced, he says with a straight face, Ba-ris) so straight. His slip-in-the-bad-Hindi-cussword is played for a laugh: you know that and you still crack up. Sending up his Russian mobster a little more would have shored up the comic tone of the film. It's left to the three guys to do the job. Good to see Kunal Khemu back in form; Das and Tiwari also have a couple of good moments. There's also a neat little twist at the end. So don't rush out of the theatres.</Review>

Zombies! It's about time the general Indian population was alerted about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic world where the dead walk and feast upon the living and bring them into their fold. I should admit that I'm a huge fan of the genre and have watched and read a lot on the subject and even enacted the part of a zombie hunter once. So for me, it was enthralling to watch Go Goa Gone in which directors Krishna DK and Raj Nidimoru have taken a giant leap in introducing zombies in the mainstream (and, importantly, calling them that) and made a superb, gut-busting film while at it. Even though it might seem a little hackneyed in a Chashme Baddooresque sense, the set up is crackling with tremendous energy from the first frame on thanks to some sharp dialogue and meta references. Three boys caught up in the drudgery of work Mondays, alcohol, drugs and obsessed with women (with the conscientious exception obviously) get a chance to drive to Goa and then a boat to a party on an island and, well, run into zombies. Their savior comes in the form of Saif Ali Khan playing Boris the faux Russian who's locked, loaded and ready to "keel dead peeple". For the producers to allow this film to end up with an 'A' certificate was a masterstroke. If it wasn't for clever expletive-punctuated dialogue and adult themes, a lot of the humor would be lost. Essentially, GGG gets right what Shootout at Wadala got terribly wrong last week. Also, the unapologetic use of English and not forcing translated Hindi words that can never seem natural in many circumstances is laudable. Take the hilarious Steve job reference that the film returns to over and over again. It's okay. Every line of all films doesn't have to be understood by everyone. Even so, the makers spend an inordinate amount of time to explain what zombies are to the uninitiated. They mask it with smart dialogue, but it can get wearisome for those in the know. By and large they do not stray from generic rules for zombies and the logic for GGG's world is solid. Well, someone had to pay for being the first. Maybe the other mainstream zombie projects in the pipeline (whatever happened to Shaadi of the Dead?) can rely on GGG's ground rules. Even though the film is short and ahem, alive, there are still some stretches which seem repetitive because of the nature of the characters and story. There is a lot of running away until, er, things turn around towards the end. And given the plethora of reference zomcom material available it must've taken great restraint by the filmmakers to not filch scenes and ideas. They succeed by and large while relying on local pop tropes (how about a dancing-around-trees Bollywood moment, but with zombies?) but look closely and you will find some inspiration from Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland (two of the finest zomcoms you can get your hands on). The ensemble's comic timing clicks and Kunal Khemu is an absolute delight and the stands out. He's looking good, is confident, and there's a certain kind of fluidity in his acting. Need to see more of him. Go Goa Gone will, hopefully, encourage filmmakers to explore new genres, let go of legacy concepts, and inject some energy into the lackluster, zombified rut of films we seem to be stuck with. For now, takes heart as our survivors use everything from an umbrella to a rocket launcher to take out the walking dead and keep you rolling over with laughter.</Review>

If the idea sounds wild, the genre driving Go Goa Gone makes the film wilder. The zom-com, triggered off by this film, is an absolutely new dish on the plate of the Bolly fan. Zom-com, or the zombie comedy, is actually a sub-genre that spoofs the classic zombie horror movie in Hollywood. Bollywood by and large has avoided zombie domain (if you discount the Ramsay attempts of yore). But that has not stopped the makers of this film from cracking a few witty ones on the undead. Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK have cocktailed two moods that Hindi cinema lovers perhaps never have seen co-exist. Go Goa Gone keeps you laughing, and yet the film manages to give you the goosebumps. If the zombie text is smartly used to create comedy, horror, action and a crazy finale, Saif Ali Khan just landed the coolest bad boy in Bollywood's mafia zone. For Saif, co-producer who turns up for a cameo, the film marks a great next level as filmmaker and actor. The story is about three friends. Hardik (Kunal Khemu) and Luv (Vir Das) are essentially slobs who are bored of their doped-out lives. So they tag along when their buddy Bunny (Anand Tiwari) flies off to Goa on a business trip. The idea is to binge on babes, booze and drugs. Spin in the tale comes when a girl named Luna (Puja Gupta) asks them over to an underground rave party organised by a Russian mafia don Boris (Saif) who, it seems, plans to launch the ultimate pleasure drug that night. Of course, not all is well at the party. Babes, booze and drugs go for a toss when the three friends discover they are hounded by zombies out to prey on them. Nidimoru and Krishna along with co-writer (Sita Menon) do not deviate from the basic formula that defines the zom-com, smoothly balancing LOL stuff with the shriek factor. Saif's Boris is among the most unforgettable characters you have met on the Bollywood screen. The peroxide hair and stubble complete the swagger for a dashing don who shoots off pucca Dilliwaala gaalis with the same flair that he shoots bullets off his gun. Saif was clearly having fun living out a wacky role. Kunal, Vir and Anand do well as the bumbling trio. It was essential to cast non-stars in these roles and the three get it just right. Go Goa Gone is your film if you like your humour with a dash of black. The sexy beaches of Goa will perhaps never be the same again on the Bollywood screen.</Review>
      <Review Id="84" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/go-goa-gone-movie-review-808" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="9th May, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="3/5">The macabre spirit of George A Romero meets the crazy core of a Bollywood comic caper in an outr?errain never seen before in a mainstream Hindi film * part Goa, part Mauritius, part tropical paradise swarming with zonked-out zombies fresh from a rave party gone horribly wrong. That is a whole lot of words, but it is actually rather easy to describe Go Goa Gone. It might be easier still to dismiss it as a misshapen genre monster. Yes, it is difficult to make sense of the film in its entirety. But that is as much its strength as its weakness. First the film*s strengths. Go Goa Gone is full of surprises: it is as if Delhi Belly on acid has strayed into Zombieland. It is anything but a mindless zombie film. It is visceral yet humorous; over the top yet perfectly controlled. It is a wild, wacky ride crammed end to end with wicked twists that all but outnumber the famished living dead that are on the trail of an unsuspecting trio of buddies, Hardik, Luv and Bunny, two of whom are high on girls, booze and cocaine. No prizes for guessing which two. The names are giveaways. As ghastly and ravenous ghouls lumber through the remote island in search of human flesh to gorge on, a bunch of four * the aforementioned friends and a footloose girl * run for cover with the help of an auburn-haired half Russian-half desi mobster called Boris. The last named is a sharpshooter who knows how to tackle the zombies. Made by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK (whose films thus far have demonstrated a healthy disregard of things predictable), Go Goa Gone thrives on an imagination that is allowed to run riot. True, not all of it clicks into place without leaving behind a bit of a mess, but the sheer audacity of the act * transporting the zombie flick to an Indian landscape puts this film in a league of its own. Go Goa Gone goes so insanely off-kilter at times that it is hard to see that the film also has an obvious underlying *say no to drugs* message. Thankfully, the message isn't the medium. The directors stay true to the demands of the genre, but they approach it with a tongue-in-cheek shuffle that randomly mixes up the key devices of the narrative. It all begins when a newly imported hardcore rave drug turns revelers at a clandestine island party into zombies, dead creatures with only a small part of the brain still working and egging them on to look for the living to feast on. And it*s about two hard-drinking, chain-smoking, coke-snorting big city drifters * one loveless, the other jobless * who drag a career-minded, straight-laced pal into a misadventure of epic proportions. Their trip quickly turns into a nightmare. Mercifully, it*s a nightmare only for the characters caught in the middle of weird muddle. For the audience, it is a source of befuddled mirth. Go Goa Gone is so manic that one guy, on discovering that a Russian girl that he had a nocturnal roll on the beach with hours earlier is now a bloodthirsty zombie on the prowl, can only say: *She was so alive last night.* Dead right! And the swaggering Mafioso, who has a wonky accent but can hurl the choicest Lajpat Nagar expletives when provoked, declares: *I kill dead people.* He is the go-to man when the zombies on the loose. Go Goa Gone is only mildly scary, but it is often very, very funny. What works is its refusal to pull back and away from its chosen course. It goes all the way down the path to the bitter end, even at the risk of turning far too jokey to be effective. That is the film*s major weakness. The zombies are, well, zombies. They multiply like maggots and after a point cease to terrorise. The film relies more on verbal exchanges than shock effects to carry itself forward. But it remains engaging despite some of the slack stretches. The acting by the principal members of the cast * Saif Ali Khan, Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari * go along with the zany spirit of the film. Puja Gupta has the easiest job: as the sole eye candy in an environment in which all other women have turned into flesh-eating creatures, she doesn't have to break into a sweat in order to stand out. Saif lays into the character of the Russian gangster with apparent relish, and both Khemu and Das, who get most of the one-liners, make an impression. The actor who steals many a scene is the deadpan Tiwari. He is the one who is supposed to provide *comic relief* in a film that is essentially a comedy. That couldn't have been a cakewalk, but he keeps his composure through the madness. Pretty much the same could be said of the film as a whole * it*s crazy but cool. It gives you what you least expect and in ways that you least anticipate. That is a rare attribute for a Hindi film. I am going with three stars for Go Goa Gone.</Review>

What you saw instead was a lovelorn rockstar who turned into an ant, lizard eating apparent zombie only after being bitten by a spider. But filmmakers Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK take a totally different approach as they deconstruct the idea of a zombie with Go Goa Gone and give it a desi twist that instantly appeases the masses. Hardik (Kunal Khemu) and Luv (Vir Das) are two dope heads, slackers, stuck in dead-end jobs. Having being dumped by girlfriend (Luv) and having lose the job (Hardik), the two losers hijack their best buddy Bunny (Anand Tiwari) on his way to work, so he can pay for the trip. Luv comes across Luna (Puja Gupta), a beautiful, free-spirited girl, and she casually invites him to exactly what they are looking for - an exclusive underground rave party on a remote island! The party is the brainchild of the macho Russian Mafioso, Boris (Saif Ali Khan), to launch the ultimate drug. But something is wrong, very wrong, on this island! All of a sudden, they are accosted by Zombies feeding on people. How they save their lives is what follows through the rest of the plot. You do not expect a zombie movie to be hilarious from the word go but Go Goa Gone doesn't cease to tickle you and you are left in splits right till the end even when the film tries to convey a very serious message. Both filmmakers Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK unapologetically present a ludicrous and farcical world of zombies, soak them in slapstick humour that is surprisingly so whacky and zany that you can't help but guffaw riotously. Even the scary portions only make you laugh and bring out the perfect blend of edgy dark humour. Technically too, Go Goa Gone is very sound. The cinematography by Lukasz Pruchnik and Dan McArthur is top notch and gives a serious competition to zombie movies of the West. Even the background setting is near perfect with the foresty feel on an obscure island. This time around it isn't the look of the actors in question but that of the many zombies that inhabit the island. The make-up artists surely deserve to be applauded in creating the perfect white-faced, blank-eyed, and bloodied zombies. What also deserves to be lauded is the music by Sachin-Jigar. Each and every song right from Slowly Slowly to Khoon Choos Le Monday to even Babaji Ki Booty has topped the charts becoming an instant hit with the urbane youth. The songs also blend brilliantly with the film. The review isn't complete without the mention of the top notch performances of the actors. The casting deserves more scores for the way they actors mouth the expletives, the corny one liners and the whacky dialogues it's all hilariously awesome! Kunal Khemu who doubles up as a dialogue writer is surprisingly delightful. So is the case with Vir Das who punches humour in every dialogue that he mouths. Anand Tiwari too plays his part well while Puja Gupta looks hot, well only meant for that in this one. Saif Ali Khan with all his blond hair, bleached beard and a fake Russian accent as he plays the zombie slayer is something you've never seen before. Go Goa Gone, in short, is a helluva adventure ride that leaves you in splits right till the end. A must watch for one and all.</Review>

Will they make it the shore safely? Movie Review: So who's a zombie? For some it's a sleep-derived person who walks around as if in a trance. For others, it's a soulless creature who can be revived by witchcraft. But in Krishna D K and Raj Nidimoru's Go Goa Gone, the zombies are some interesting creatures who've overdosed on a drug that is said to be more dangerous than MDMA, or Ecstasy as most of us know it. And now these living people have turned into a brain-dead lot who know nothing but hunger. So where do you find these zombies. Wait. Let's start at the beginning. Three fun-seeking friends*Kunal Khemu(Hardik), Vir Das(Luv) and Anand Tiwari(Bunny) join Puja Gupta(Luna) at a rave party in Goa. Their host is a Russian Don*Saif Ali Khan(Boris). The night is young; the company vivacious. Drinks are aplenty and the drugs lethal. As the party reaches a crescendo, the friends find themselves enthralled. Alas, there's a price to be paid. Each of the three friends wakes up the next morning `wasted' and in fairly interesting company. They have a zombie or two in their vicinity. Scared out of their wits, the three friends and their girlfriend, Luna, run for their lives. But it isn't that easy. The island is now home to a large group of fast-mutliplying zombies, who are eager to make these human-beings `meat' for their insatiable appetite. Boris, their knight-in-shining-armour attempts to rescue them but the zombies are not easy to shake off. As the part hilarious, part scary adventure continues, you find yourself laughing aloud with the three boys and their wisecracks. And you also find yourself scared shitless of the zombies who keep cropping up unannounced in their creepy avatar. Go Goa Gone is positively different from anything you seen before. And for the young and restless(tattooed, ring-pierced, rave-party enthusiasts) or even those who like whacked-out fun, it's a great ride. With easy performances from Kunal, Saif, Vir and Anand and the crackerjack dialogue, the film will keep you in splits for the most part. What is a little tiring though,is the pace of the zombies, who are a bit too monotonous. Sachin-Jigar's Babaji ki booti adds to the mood, almost tempting you to light up and lie back. The shores of Goa and Mauritius seem enticing enough. However some of the situations in GGG are repititive. Hence, the laughs that were coming spontaneously till a point become a bit forced at some juncture.</Review>

Besides, the supernatural and horror genre is fast gaining popularity with dream merchants, after a hiatus. Now, storytellers in Mumbai are geared up to take the genre to an altogether new level, introducing the spectators to zombies. GO GOA GONE, directed by Raj and DK, is India's first 'zom-com'. Romance, action and comedy continue to be the most privileged genres in Bollywood, but the past few years have witnessed a number of experiments catching the audience eye. Fear and hilarity are opposite sides of the coin. To amalgamate them in a movie script requires a truly fertile mind because you don't anticipate humor and horror to go hand-in-hand. The expectations from GO GOA GONE are, evidently, colossal, in view of the fact that something like this hasn't been attempted on the Hindi screen earlier, although cineastes have witnessed zombies in Hollywood films. A zom-com can pave the way for movies of similar genre in times to come, if it finds an audience... GO GOA GONE is looked forward to for varied reasons: The zom-com aspect, zany look of the film, Saif's bleached getup [he plays a zombie killer in the movie], wicked one-liners and enticing music... But the challenge lies in educating the spectator about zombies, since there's no zombie folklore to enlighten them thus far. Let's face it, making a zom-com means treading into untried, alien territory. It's always a peril if you think out of the box, when you offer something innovative to the spectator. At the same time, a subject like this offers ample opportunity to its maker to break rules. But Raj and DK pull it off with flourish! A film like GO GOA GONE pushes the envelope and that, without beating around the bush, needs to be lauded! Hardik [Kunal Khemu] and Luv [Vir Das] tag along to Goa with their best buddy, Bunny [Anand Tiwari], on his office trip. Luv comes across Luna [Puja Gupta], who invites him to an exclusive rave party on a remote island. The party is the brainchild of Russian mafioso Boris [Saif Ali Khan] to launch the ultimate party drug. But the party goes horribly wrong... All of a sudden, they are accosted by zombies! GO GOA GONE comes across more as an adventure flick than a conventional horror film. Sure, it has its share of violence and gore, besides some cuss words, rave party et al, but the fun quotient is smartly integrated in the screenplay and what comes across is crazy, madcap amusement. The humor is smart and the factors that have resulted in an 'A' certificate have been done aesthetically and don't come across as distasteful or offensive. Frankly, Raj and DK make a genuine effort to give the viewers something they haven't watched before. The aim is to make you giggle and also shriek the next moment. Perhaps, Raj and DK are enthused by Hollywood movies and there's no denying that GO GOA GONE is a film with Hollywood sensibilities. But the best part is that the film never gets dark or depressing. The wit and humor, generously interwoven in the narrative, keeps you smiling all through, despite the blood and gore. The only time the film loses its balance is towards the middle of the second hour, albeit slightly. Also, Anand Tiwari's back story of how he escaped from the clutches of the zombies could've been more persuasive, but the final moments bring the narrative back on track. The soundtrack [Sachin-Jigar] is essential to the script and has its place in the proceedings. The film comprises of energetic tracks with some amusing, quirky lyrics. 'Khoon Choos Le' and 'Babaji Ki Booty' match the theme of the film wonderfully. The background score is electrifying. The music piece at the rave party in particular is trippy. Dialogue, much like the content of the film, are aimed at the youngistaan and if one may say so, make you chuckle on varied occasions. Cinematography is perfect. Saif balances the suave and uncouth persona with effortlessness. Even if the narrative tends to dip at times, Saif makes sure he breathes life into the proceedings. Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari are a riot. The youngsters pull off their acts and indulge in dramatics without going overboard. The camaraderie is great! Kunal is a revelation. He sheds all inhibitions and delivers a punch-packed performance. Vir Das is a complete natural. He essays his part with super conviction. Anand Tiwari is in terrific form. This film should prove a big turnaround in his career. Puja gets a meaty part to make her presence felt and she does very well. On the whole, GO GOA GONE is experimental since something like this has never been attempted earlier. But it's fun, witty, amusing and yes, thoroughly entertaining. The youngistaan is sure to love this mad, mad, mad ride!</Review>

Even its ostensible hero * Saif Ali Khan, whose star wattage lit up the film*s promos, plays  a blonde Russian named Boris (he calls himself Barees) *  isn't so much the centre of the film as part of an ensemble. This isn't just the instance of a big hero opting to inhabit a juicy character role, the way Khan did in Omkara, or an attention-grabbing guest role or special appearance. Here, he*s literally one the gang, playing a part that clocks up less screen time than his costars. (He appears fairly late in the film, and then vanishes for a long stretch.) If all actors were to divide their careers between lucrative junk like Race 2 and small passion projects like this one, the local multiplex would be a happier place to visit. The second most impressive aspect of Go Goa Gone may be that it knows what it wants to do * clear a low bar * and does it pretty well, with a jaunty tone (the film opens with a Chiranjeevi music video based on Michael Jackson*s Thriller) and cheerfully foul-mouthed one-liners. The story is about a couple of joint-loving slackers * Luv (Vir Das) and Hardik (Kunal Khemu, who*s excellent; he really should do more comedy) * and their earnest roommate Bunny (Anand Tiwari) who go in search of an underground rave party in Goa and end up being chased by zombies. (They*re joined by the shapely Luna, played by Puja Gupta.) Go Goa Gone has nothing on its mind but laughs, so the portions that attempt to evoke an emotional response feel forced. And after a while, there*s a sense of sameness * even at 110 minutes, the film feels overlong. But there*s always a joke around the corner, like a boob-shaped squeeze toy or a boat named Tatinic or the sight gag involving an insane running-around-trees moment . The third most impressive aspect of Go Goa Gone? It may just be the most tongue-in-cheek anti-drugs PSA ever.</Review>

Gurpreet Kaur, the 14-year-old protagonist of Gippi (Riya Vij), ticks all the boxes. She's routinely taunted by the mean girl in class, ignored by all the popular kids, and can barely squeeze into her uniform. An unlikely friendship with the school jock (Taaha Shah) ends embarrassingly for Gippi, and in a weak moment she even accepts a challenge to win the Head Girl elections. Despite its promising premise, evocative of the quirky American comedy Napoleon Dynamite, writer-director Sonam Nair's debut film hits rough patches because the writing is so derivative, few of the characters feel particularly original or interesting. The key tragedy with the film is that while some of Nair's ideas are progressive and strong, her execution seldom matches up. The film addresses puberty, menstruation and sex education, but these scenes never achieve a matter-of-fact, 'normal' tone. Instead Nair appears to be calling out to the viewer, demanding appreciation for her 'mature' choices. It doesn't help that the film's misfit heroine never endears herself as an underdog worth rooting for. Sure it's hard being a teenager but Nair bequeaths Gippi with a prickly attitude in place of angst. Instead, scattered sparkling moments come from Gippi's solemn best friend Aanchal (Doorva Tripathi) and her podgy younger brother Booboo (Arbaaz Kadwani). Of the cast, Divya Dutta humanizes the somewhat hard-to-digest, selfless character of Gippi's single mother who not only encourages her kids to go to their father's second marriage, but even accompanies them and poses for pictures with her ex and his new bride. Ultimately, this could have been a sweet, unusual tale about the triumph of a nerd, yet it's let down by its affected tone. I'm going with two out of five for Gippi. Alas, many of the film's better ideas are lost in execution.</Review>
      <Review Id="90" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/review-gippi-is-a-mini-version-of-student-of-the-year/1114064/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="11th May, 2013" Likes="7" Rating="2/5">Bollywood's awakening to the age of teens, and the in-between individuals who live in this zone, is a fairly new thing. Gippi takes the genre further down the road with its 14-year-old protagonist, more tween than teen. Gippi is roly poly, likes jiving to Shammi Kapoor songs, and thinks nothing of snacking between meal-times. She keeps her mom in good humour, fights with her younger brother Booboo, and is happy with her best friend. Then, like all teenagers, she finds a crush and a contest, and that's when Gippi finds who she really is. You know where this film is going when you see this beetle-browed young girl being the butt of jokes in class and outside. You know that this is a coming-of-age, and it is a genre that you never tire of, because growing up can mean so many new, wondrous things. The problem is when the tale is neither new, nor wondrous. Gippi takes its cues from the madly popular Mean Girls and Gossip Girl: actually, not just cues, but entire templates. So school becomes a place for vicious fights between the overweight, unpopular Gippi and the very svelte, very mean Shamira (Modi), where a tussle between the two for the position of head girl plays out more like who will be prom queen. The actors, most of them fresh young faces, all have promise. The scenes between Gippi and her single, working, middle-class mom (Dutta), and brother (Kadwani) have real sweetness. Vij as Gippi is both vulnerable and believable. The trouble is not so much with the performers but with what they are asked to do in an idiom borrowed from American teen dramas: they all, except for one or two, speak Hindi with effort, telling us they'd be more at home in English. The bitchy Miss Ambitious is like so many attitude-striking Hollywood teen queens. I'm sure there are kids like this, who model themselves on popular characters in TV sitcoms, but what's the point of seeing them in a Hindi film? This comes off as a mini version of the Karan Johar-directed Student Of The Year, which was itself derivative. It's nice for Gippi to be saying what it does. That fat and frumpy is not bad. That it is quite all right to be who you are, and not anyone else. That winning is not everything. But it would have been nicer if it had been said in a newer, fresher way.</Review>

You're fat. You're insecure. You think you can dance. But you trip and fall. A lot. The mirror is your best friend. Time stands still when you're in front of it. The reflection is your world. Only when you look away does time fast forward to the present and you feel like a fool. Meanwhile your other best friend is overtaking you in the significant other department. And she's the loser. But she's your friend. Does that make you a loser? Hmm. You've trouble at home too. Mother's upset. Father's missing. Sometimes you're the only one holding it together. You're somewhat delusional. Occasionally toying with the idea of suicide. Never too seriously though. Then comes love. At least what you believe is love. Then the crush is crushed. And comes a new beginning. A contest, a rival, other boys. This time winning is everything. Do you identify with Gippi yet? Surely at some level you must. Karan Johar is quite the shape shifting filmmaker these days. Director/Producer KJ gives us blockbuster escapist fare with Student of the Year; Producer KJ backs Gippi, in many ways the antithesis of Student of the Year; and Director KJ gives you a hard-as-nails drama in Bombay Talkies that is nothing like he's ever done before. Where in SOTY it was all about rich kids, thin kids, designer labels, song and dance, and winning; Gippi has nothing of the sort. The heroes of SOTY are the villains of Gippi. But here's the conundrum and the most interesting bit: the tweens and teens enthralled with SOTY are going to love Gippi too. They aren't going to care that the conflict took a while coming, before the slice-of-life film turned into a coming-of-age one. They won't care that a significant amount of information comes across in montages. Will it matter to them that Hollywood has been playing with these cliches for a long time (though it's only recently that producers in India are waking up to the fact that film audiences can have varied tastes)? Doubt it. And they won't mind the netherworld between realistic and Dharma Productions that Gippi is stuck in, in the look and feel department. They won't care because there are too many moments of universal truths. They will have a lump in their throats when it's time. They might learn a life lesson or two. And they're going to cheer for the underdog. Because they will identify. Because they are Gippi and Gippi is them. Debutant Sonam Nair is fuzzy around the edges with her direction, and has difficulty getting across to her young actors. In telling outtakes during the end credit titles, you will find a bunch of instances where the director is acting out the scene for the actor to replicate. This can't be very effective. You'll only get performances as good you can deliver. And you're the director. Still, here's a big hurrah for the girls of Gippi. Special mentions for Riya Vij, Doorva Tripathi, and Divya Dutta. Earnest efforts will always find many takers.</Review>

Her mom is called Pappi, and she has a brother named Booboo. Sonam Nair's debut directorial feature underlines the cute quotient right at the outset with its character names. Gippi is a little tribute to growing up, and the film takes an indulgent look at the wonder years through the story of a 14-year-old. Riya Vij is cast in the title role of Gippi, a pleasantly plump teenager battling the bulge and coming to terms with all the changes that life brings at her age. Life is far from perfect, of course. Gippi comes from a broken home, is normally a backbencher at school, and is routinely bullied by the campus queen-bee, Shamira (Jayati Modi). It does not help either that her first love is doomed to fail. The film comes with a familiar baggage of funny teachers, crush on a filmstar (in Gippi's case, Shammi Kapoor), and a yen for the yummy. The standard melodrama-loaded finale also aptly falls in place once Gippi takes on Shamira in the campus elections. The fun factor works for the film till a point, and Gippi does leave a subtle message for its young adult target audience: To succeed in life, first learn to love yourself as you are. Riya Vij is spontaneous as Gippi. The mom-daughter chemistry between Riya and Divya Dutta is natural, too. But the film could have done with some solid writing, notably in the second half. Gippi is a coming-of-age flick that doesn't quite come of age.</Review>

But with our Hindi films coming of the age, it is even the Karan Johars of the industry are stumping the Indian audience by moving away from their comfort zone. Who would have thought Dharma Productions synonymous with grandiose would ever produce a film deprived of even a single star, big sets and a film made on shoe string budget? They do that with Gippi. But the question remains would this gamble work? Let's find out. Gippi (Riya Vij) is characteristically a 14 year old adolescent; she is plump, unpopular, academically poor and the butt of all jokes of the snobby popular troupe of the school. Her life in school is centered around her BFF Anchal (Doorva) with whom she shares all growing up hassles right from her menstrual cycle to having a crush on an older boy, while at home it's her mother (Divya Dutta) and her brother Boo Boo (Arbaz Kadwani) who form her world. She doesn't mind being picked on for a joke, she doesn't care for what others think until Arjun (Taaha Shah) a high school bad boy walks into her life and she gets challenged by the Mean B Shamira (Jayati) to stand for the head girl elections. What happens follows through the rest of the plot. First time director Sonam Nair peeps into the lives of each and every young teenager including herself and presents a story strikes a chord instantly. You are either amongst Gippi and her friends or you have once been through her life. The age bracket of adolescence and adulthood, of being at the crossroads gets aptly tackled in the film by Sonam without so much as the rona-dhona or the melodramatic angles. The filmmaker takes a very simple route to deal with some of the most crucial growing up troubles yet deals with them with ample sensitivity sans any frivolity. But that doesn't take away the fun quotient for there's ample in that department too. While the first half is pacey and breezy, it's the second that starts appearing tad stretched and despite having a short run time of 97 minutes you feel the length of the film. The shortcomings of the film get covered up by the near perfect casting of the film. There couldn't be a better Gippi than Riya Vij. She is chubby, chirpy, arrogant yet sensitive and every bit like any teenage girl her age. Even Arbaz Kadwani as the fatty younger brother is brilliant in his part. Divya Dutta is her usual perfect self and briskly moves between being the mother and the friend. Taaha Shah as the bad boy too is convincing. Gippi is fun, Gippi is relatable and Gippi is every bit adorable. A film should definitely make a hit at least among the school kids, especially as the film smartly releases during the summer vacations!</Review>
      <Review Id="94" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/gippi-movie-review-809" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="9th May, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="3/5">Yippee, it*s Gippi! Sadly, that isn't the reaction that this well-intentioned but uneven film is likely to elicit. A low budget release from Dharma Productions is certainly news. It isn't news, however, when a film about growing up isn't quite all that grown up. For all its attempts to look and feel different from the run-of-the-mill, Gippi is pretty obviously not the ultimate film about adolescence. But there is no denying that it is a warm-hearted film, if nothing else, with some nice touches that might strike an emotional chord. The pivotal character of the film is an eponymous overweight 14-year-old Shimla schoolgirl who lives with her single mom and younger brother and jives to Shammi Kapoor songs. She comes across as real and believable. The girl*s mother (Divya Dutta), who runs a beauty parlour to earn her family*s keep, also emerges as a character that one can relate to. She is a Punjabi woman who has been unceremoniously dumped by her husband (Pankaj Dheer) because she is too earthy for his liking. But she is a tough cookie who lives her life on her own terms. The manner in which the mother-daughter relationship unfolds is really the best part of Gippi. *You can talk to me, mamma,* the teenager says when her mother needs to share her innermost feelings. The mother reciprocates in kind. *Bras, boyfriends, parties, you are a big girl,* she tells her pre-pubescent daughter when the latter seeks permission for a night out. Unfortunately, none of the other relationships and connections that the film explores is half as tangible. Gippi (Riya Vij) frets no end over all the little highs and lows that are a part and parcel of a teenage girl*s life, but the problem that bugs her the most is her girth, which is the butt of insensitive ridicule in school and elsewhere. So far so good. Unfortunately, the narrative tropes that first-time director Sonam Nair takes recourse to in portraying life on the school campus and the many challenges it poses for a girl who is happy in her own skin are ham-fisted and trite. It is all bunged in for conventional dramatic effect: the tussle for boyfriends, a fractious election for school head girl, heartbreaks, heated confrontations and life-altering revelations. There*s nothing particularly original in there. While Gippi faces constant ribbing on account of how she looks, she, on her part, loses no opportunity to direct unkind jibes at her own brother, Booboo (Arbaz Kadwani), for his apparent lack of interest in the opposite sex. The crucial turning points in the plot are rather unimaginatively handled, often pushing an otherwise commendable effort into all-encompassing shallowness. Especially appalling is the cringingly poor writing in the pre-interval party scene * remember this is a Karan Johar production and boisterous parties are at the very heart of human existence. Gippi*s escort for the evening, Arjun (Tahaa Shah), a much older boy that she has a crush on, turns out to be an insufferable oaf, and her bitter classroom rival, Shamira (Jayati Modi), the girl with the hot bod, high marks and pots of money, humiliates her in public. Surely a girl who goes to the best school in town would have the sense and social finesse not to call a classmate a *fat, ugly loser* without any apparent provocation. But she does because the screenplay desperately needs her to be obnoxious. Gippi has many such awkwardly overwrought scenes, none worse than the one that pits the girl*s mamma against her estranged husband at the latter*s second wedding with a foreigner. At the end of it, when peace has been restored by the spunky Gippi, they all pose for a happy family portrait. Gippi is a feel-good drama and everything, even an overdose of clumsy preaching, is fair when the principal pursuit is happiness. We encounter *life* on school and college campuses rather frequently in Hindi cinema * the last time we did so was as recently as in Karan Johar*s Student of the Year. What is noteworthy in Gippi is that, for a change, we have actors playing their age. Riya Vij is delightfully good as the fun girl who takes all the blows of life on the chin and smiles through it all. Divya Dutta, too, is perfectly cast as the irrepressible mom. All the young actors in the cast pull their weight to the extent that the screenplay allows them to. One actor who is particularly hard done by is Jayati Modi. It*s the most sketchily written part in Gippi and she does herself no favours by letting the utter lack of subtlety in the characterization guide her. She is unnecessarily and gratingly shrill. The musical score is a mind-boggling mish-mash. It is like an ode to cultural confusion of the worst order. One robust Punjabi routine is followed by a soulful Man bawra ditty; and that is followed by a vacuous Bhojpuri number (that extols the transformation of a *baby* to a *baby doll*), which then is followed by a song in Pidgin English (that celebrates the fact that *we are like this only*). Can't be good advertisement for any self-respecting school in the hills!</Review>

She's no topper. Far from a head-turner. She's Gippi (Riya), a gregarious, gol-matol gal. The bindaas backbencher, who doesn't sweat over low scores in class, or being overweight with mass. Damn the parlours, beauty queens, gossip gals and fashion magazines, these aren't her favourite subjects. There's lot more going on in her small world of 'heavy-weight' teenage troubles. Gippi is the class klutz and the butt of jokes; no thanks to motaapa and her 'boyfriendless' status. She shares her naivete (and other 'horny' secrets and 'men'strual issues) with her BFF Aanchal (Doorva). Gippi's strongest support is her bro Booboo (Arbaz), as well-rounded as his name, and single supermom (Divya) who grooms her on everything from bras to boyfriends. When the Mean-Bee, Shamira (Jayati), challenges Gippi to compete at the school elections, she suddenly finds a goal, but will the free-spirited Gippi transform herself in to one of the 'mean girls'? Riya shows her adolescence angst with childlike mannerisms and sweet, spontaneous reactions. Jayati is a regular high-school hip babe; Doorva is endearing with her oil-soaked plaits and guileless expressions. Arbaz entertains with his fetish for all things girlie, except the gals. Taaha scores well, and Divya Dutta excels in her part. Sonam Nair's 'coming of puberty' film handles simple issues sensitively, though it doesn't delve too deep. The subtlety appeals, but lacks drama in the second half, with a mediocre climax. Teenagers will find a slice of their life in Gippi, and adults might protest to such 14-somethings extreme indulgences in fashion, hot-bods and green-tea diets. The mom-daughter moments exude emotions and shed the typical broken-home baggage. Overall, a simple story that stays pre-pubescent and doesn't quite grow into the high-school of stories.</Review>

STANLEY KA DABBA. CHILLAR PARTY... Several prominent film-makers have made films that transport you to your early days. Now Karan Johar takes you back to your teenage years with GIPPI, directed by first-timer Sonam Nair. While this is Karan/Dharma's first film with a lady director, it also marks the production house's foray at narrating a story minus 'stars'. The focus, obviously, is on kids here, but let me add in the same breath, the confidence that these kids emanate easily equals most skilled actors of our times. We're often asked, which have been the best years of our lives? As one reflects on the years gone by, one realizes that the years spent in school were the best, for sure. Of course, one didn't value it as much then, but the truth dawns upon you in the latter years of life. GIPPI takes a leaf out of our lives to recount an account that one can relate to. Frankly, Gippi's could be yours, mine, anybody's story. Many of us go through a phase that's between teens and adulthood. Films like GIPPI talk to every parent, every child since kids, generally, at that age, don't know how to deal with situations and challenges that life throws at them. The feeling of insecurity, anxiety, edginess that one experiences during those years is delightfully captured through the various kids in the film. Gippi [Riya Vij] is a 14-year-old living in Shimla with her single parent [Divya Dutta] and younger brother Booboo [Arbaz Kadwani]. She's plump, self-conscious and doesn't know how to handle the changes in her life. In school, she's constantly bullied by Shamira [Jayati Modi]. At home, she's waking up to the fact that her father [Pankaj Dheer] is all set to walk down the aisle with another woman. During the engagement ceremony of her father, Gippi is introduced to Arjun [Taaha Shah], a senior in the school. She's attracted to him, but mistakes his friendship for love. However, the love story comes to an embarrassing end at Shamira's party, who's quite a snob. Gippi decides to take life in her hands and contest the school elections against Shamira... I've often observed, several films that attempt to address teen issues neatly appear exasperating and phony. Not GIPPI. This one's well done, captures the emotions sensitively and is packed with anecdotes that make this motion picture pleasurable. Sonam does complete justice to the written material of a youngster putting together her own coming-of-age story. The issues depicted in the movie, the metamorphosis that Gippi goes through, the bitter-sweet episodes... nothing seems conventional or borrowed from films of a similar variety. Sonam, who has assisted Ayan Mukerji and Vishal Bhardwaj, seems like a proficient storyteller, for technically speaking, there are no glitches and the storytelling is devoid of hiccups as well. Besides, handling the kids and nurturing them into delivering polished performances is a cumbersome task and Sonam seems accomplished here as well. Vishal-Shekhar's soundtrack does not skip the emotions and keeps the spectator all glued during the songs. The usage of yesteryear hits is, of course, an added bonus. Anshuman Mahaley's cinematography captures the stunning hilly terrain and the beauty of Himachal Pradesh with flourish. The kids are the stars of the enterprise! Riya essays her part with utmost understanding, depicting every emotion with such natural ease. Arbaz, enacting the part of Gippi's brother, is endearing. Doorva Tripathi, as Gippi's best friend Anchal, is wonderful. Jayati Modi plays the snob with flawlessness. Mrinal Chawla, as Kabir, is wonderfully restrained. Aditya Deshpande, as Ashish, is just right. Divya Dutta gets to portray several emotions in her character and the actress, like always, is in terrific form. Pankaj Dheer is perfect in a brief role. Taaha Shah looks his part and acts very well. Raqesh Vashisht doesn't get much scope. On the whole, GIPPI is a credible take on the 'coming-of-age' variety of movies. This one's straight from the heart. Sweet, simple, emotionally engaging, heart-warming cinema!</Review>

Think about your own*looking back, the absolute artlessness and agony of it won't inspire anything but tragedy, will it? Or dark humour, if you*re capable of it. Adolescence has inspired all kinds of movies: immensely enjoyable feel-good comedies, mostly from Hollywood, as well as masterpieces about its indispensable darkness. Fran?s Truffaut*s tormented Antoine (The 400 Blows) and Catherine Breillat*s Ana?(Fat Girl), quietly in rage, hurtling to her stunning end, are riveting portraits. There aren't many films about adolescence and teenage in Hindi cinema that go beyond campus romance and rivalry, into its emotional struggles*barring Vikramaditya Motwane*s Udaan and Sanjivan Lal*s Bubble Gum which were also about the conflict between the adult and adolescent worlds. So the premise of debut director Sonam Nair*s Gippi, the journey of an overweight 14-year-old dealing with her peers and coming to terms with herself, is refreshing to begin with. Written also by her, the film is about Gurpreet Kaur or Gippi (Riya Vij), who studies in a co-ed school in Shimla. She lives with her mother (Divya Dutta) and brother (Arbaz Kadwani), and the estranged father (whom the children still meet) is about to marry for a second time. Gippi is the target of ridicule. Her friends, Anchal (Doorva Tripathi) and Ashish (Aditya Deshpande), are like her, and the overachiever of the class, Shamira (Jayati Modi), challenges Gippi to run for head girl. Gippi meets boys who break her heart. She frowns and fumes her way through embarrassments and her father*s wedding party. She consoles her embittered mother. Nair borrows heavily from Hollywood romcoms, which makes it an odd Indian-American mash-up*think about a traditional, Punjabi-speaking lady (Gippi*s mother), heartbroken by abandonment, attending her former husband*s wedding party and posing for a *family photo*. photo Gippi*s anger is about things obviously and literally played out. Every humiliation is exaggerated. Wearing a bra for the first time, reaching out for a Stayfree (Stayfree gets more than one mention in the story, as brand placement)*these are crucial pointers; important details of Gippi*s journey. Nair*s story is set to famous Shammi Kapoor songs*supposed to imply, perhaps, that like Shammi, she is overweight, frumpy and romantic. There are some sweet moments in Gippi. But the film*s problem is the character itself. Gippi is not adolescent enough*she begins as a girl seething in her own awkwardness and jealousies, and ends as a saint almost, in love with everything about herself and her life. Laboriously performed by Vij*most actors, except Deshpande and Kadwani, can't effectively bring out the foolish convictions of a 14-year-old*Gippi*s end will strike a chord more with the middle-aged than with girls her age. The film has the universally acceptable message that most self-help books will give you: Love your flaws, love yourself. A film needs some more meat; it can't thrive on a message. When storytelling, characterization and performance are lost, all is lost.</Review>

No, it*s not surprising that the first Bollywood film about 14-year-olds comes from the man who arguably first imported the American high school fantasy * a la Archie Comics* Riverdale * into our cinema, with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998, and also gave us last October*s updated version: Student of the Year. What*s surprising is that unlike the perfectly-coiffed glossy creatures masquerading as schoolkids in Johar*s films, his production of Sonam Nair*s Gippi has a school that actually seems like a school, and kids who mostly look and behave like kids. Most surprising of all is its heroine. Admittedly, the plump child (who might have something to do with Johar*s own past, if his interviews are to be believed) has figured occasionally in his oeuvre: but either he grows up to be Hrithik Roshan, as in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, or he*s relegated to being the nerdy nice boy who*s still sadly single eight years after school, as in SOTY. It*s pretty remarkable, then, that Nair*s directorial debut not just allows its plump protagonist to be the film*s heroine, but actually celebrates her refusal to be made over. Courtesy: ibn live Divya Dutta and Riya Vij in a still from the film. Image courtesy: ibn live The plot is uncomplicated but the things it deals with are refreshingly new on the Hindi film screen. Gurpreet Kaur, better known as Gippi, is a regular 14-year-old with regular issues, stemming mostly * but not only * from her slightly more-than-regular weight. Her school uniform*s grown too tight for her over the summer, she feels fat and unattractive and a bit of a klutz. Add to all this the problems of puberty: growing breasts, getting your period, acquiring a bra * and falling in love. But what makes everything worse is that whenever Gippi has an embarrassing moment * her chair tipping over or her buttons popping open or her chemistry experiment blowing up in her face * her Little Miss Perfect classmate Shamira is waiting around the corner, ready to rub it in. And then Gippi finds herself competing for school elections against Shamira* What*s ironic is that Shamira * the slim, high-achieving, fashionable rich girl * is really a version of the heroine in a Kuch Kuch or SOTY. Except that instead of being a Poor Little Rich Girl that we*re supposed to sympathise with, Shamira*s version of Little Miss Perfect is here cast as nastiness personified. Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising, then, that Jayati Modi*s rather-too-shrill attempts to bring Shamira*s excessive villainy to life are responsible for the falsest notes in the film: especially her cruel outburst against Gippi at the party. The only time Shamira seems somewhat believable is during the climax, when the film decides to turn around and give us an insight into the pains it takes to maintain her self-anointed heroine status. *I haven't eaten ice cream for three months,* she declares in a hilarious self-pity speech. *Even my goddamn socks have to be perfect!* But if Shamira is a cardboard cutout, Gippi and her friends are endearingly recognizable * even if they*re types. There*s the slow but ever-reliable best friend, Aanchal (Doorva Tripathi), the slightly doltish but utterly sweet admirer, Ashish, and the supportive younger brother Booboo (Arbaaz Kadwani). Taaha Shah, who debuted as Luv in 2011*s Luv ka the End (a *youth* movie of the exact sort one is glad this one isn't), puts in a satisfying turn as Arjun the dreamboat * a senior school boy whom Gippi runs into and develops a convincing first crush on. And then there*s the wonderful Divya Dutta, who brings an attractive combination of vulnerability and joie-de-vivre to her role as Gippi*s recently-divorced mum. It*s true that the parents* super-civilized divorce, with the mother actually attending the father*s second shaadi, seem a little impossible to believe in Gippi*s social context. But Dutta*s arc of the narrative * the non-English-speaking, beauty-parlour-running mother whose husband (Pankaj Dheer) has unceremoniously replaced her with a leggy young white woman * provides a nice companion track to the film*s central message: that it*s crucial to find confidence in who you are, and if the people you find attractive think you*re not cool enough for them, well, they*re the ones losing out. The moments between Gippi and her mother are some of the loveliest in the film, and one feels grateful that Dutta*s character doesn't need an English Vinglish style makeover-plus-speech to earn the respect of her children. At the centre of the film is the young Riya Vij, perfectly personifying the sometimes sulky, dance-crazy schoolgirl who*s picked Shammi Kapoor as the alternative soundtrack to her life. When Gippi dons a yellow feather boa and a mad wig to shake wildly to Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe, you can't help but be thrilled at her liberating lack of feminine modesty. The idea of Gippi may well be inspired by popular Western TV shows like Gossip Girl and My Mad Fat Diary, but Sonam Nair does succeed in giving us a heartwarming, almost believable Bollywood version of an Indian teenage world * and one in which hot boys and fat loss aren't the answer to one*s troubles. I say, Yahoo!</Review>

      <Review Id="99" Name="Anupama Chopra" Expected="" Link="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Critics-review-Bombay-Talkies-is-Karan-Johar-s-victory/Article1-1054265.aspx" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="3rd May, 2013" Likes="71" Rating="on the website">An ode to 100 years of Indian cinema - that is not the only factor that makes Bombay Talkies a different film. Here is one film that was not being promoted for it's star cast (let us not forget that the producers made sure almost all stars, living and dead, make an appearance in the film) or it's amazing story. Bombay Talkies could be the first film that was being sold merely in the name of its directors. Interestingly, four of the most iconic film directors came together to make the movie that celebrates the spirit of Indian cinema. Anurag Kashyap, Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee and Zoya Akhtar together succeed in capturing the essence of passion and madness about Indian cinema. Just days before the theatrical release of Bombay Talkies, talking to Anupama Chopra on Front Row (Star World), Anurag Kashyap had said that audiences will see a new and different Karan Johar with this movie. Anurag also said that the filmmaker inside Karan is stuffed somewhere inside the garb of a producer but with Bombay Talkies, the filmmaker takes the liberty of coming out. The filmmaker has certainly scored with Bombay Talkies. Going by the reviews, Karan Johar's story explores the difficulties of living a lie, coming to terms with one's own sexuality and the emotions involved. Rani Mukerjee receives rave reviews for her acting and so does Saquib Saleem. It is a story where an Entertainment Editor (Rani Mukerjee), her husband and News TV anchor (Randeep Hooda) and an intern (Saquib Saleem) are entangled in their own web of lies and emotions. Karan Johar succeeds in surprising the audience with his short film in Bombay Talkies. Tushar Joshi, film critic with DNA writes, "Johar handles the sensitive subject with maturity and shows a side to him we hope he digs deep into." It is a day of praises for Karan Johar it seems. Simantini Dey writes for Firstpost, "Shrugging off all the candy floss and melodrama that are the trademarks of his films, Johar seems to have picked a subject that's close to his heart and not necessarily guaranteed to win over audiences. And he proves he is a consummate storyteller." Dibakar Banerjee is efficient in his use of the acting prowess of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Loosely based on Satyajit Ray's Potol Babu, Dibkar makes full use of Nawazuddin's acting chops. In his short story for Bombay Talkies, Dibakar explores the character of an aspiring actor who accidently gets to work in a film. Saibal Chatterjee (NDTV) writes, "Dibakar Banerjee gives full rein to what he is good at - capturing the joys and despairs of "that little man" in the crowd." Tushar Joshi for DNA writes, "On paper Dibakar's story must have been a fantastic read, but its transition to the big screen is a bit sketchy. While you can't really go wrong with casting Siddiqui, there are parts where the actor himself seems a bit confused about what's happening around him." Nawazuddin, nonetheless, manages to enlighten the screen with his acting skills. A standard Dibakar Banerjee movie is what you get - no more, yet no less. In tandem with expectations, Zoya Akhtar's story wonderfully explores the emotions of a kid who idolises style diva Katrina Kaif and wants to be like her. Zoya's story holds a lot of potential but critics feel she fails to explore them. Tushar Joshi writes for DNA, "Zoya doesn't really delve into the boy's psyche. She merely presents a situation that focuses more on his craze for Katrina rather than the outcome of that emotion." But, unlike Karan and Dibakar's stories, Zoya narrates a story about the madness associated with Indian cinema - in line with the theme of Bombay Talkies. She also brings out the talent of Naman Jain quite efficiently. Naman has impressed the critics with his acting. Film critic Mayank Shekhar says, "Karan Johar's short film incidentally isn't centred on a larger-than-life male character who can sweep mushy women off their feet... Suffice it to say both Johar and Akhtar's films deal with the same theme and while one is rather rebellious and angry (and that is Johar's film by the way!), the other movie is bitter-sweet and dreamy...If anything, Karan's film is the most experimental of the lot, at any rate it is the most unlikely one from the director. Zoya's is the most intimate, Dibakar's is the most evocative, and Anurag's is quite easily the most 'filmy'." Moving on to the last leg of Bombay Talkies, Anurag Kashyap's Murabba is a typical Anurag Kashyap story with the Amitabh Bachchan fan (Vineet kuamr Singh) trying to meet the Big B on the behest of his father (Sudhir Pandey). Anurag manages to capture the madness, the respect a fan holds for his icon. Talking about his story in Bombay Talkies, Anurag Kashyap had said that it was actually his story as he, too, is a huge fan of Amitabh Bachchan. Anurag had also confessed that while Karan Johar's stint would be the most experimental, Kashyap's attempt would be at making a typical Bollywood masala. Indulging the fan in himself, Anurag actually succeeds in getting the most 'filmy story' in Bombay Talkies. As Simantini Dey sums it up, "While Johar finally comes out of the cinema closet and admits to being a smarter, more sensitive and less masaledaar filmmaker, Kashyap seems to be running out of ideas."</Review>

A father, determined to enthrall his bored daughter, narrates a story in mime, his energy palpable, his excitement contagious. A little boy, attired in his sister's dress and his mother's make-up and heels, shakes his hips to the beats of a popular dance number, blissfully naive to the likely reaction of his family. And a young out-of-towner is reduced to tears as he pleads earnestly to the security guards manning the gates of a superstar's home for one meeting with the legend. It's these images that linger in your mind long after you've watched 'Bombay Talkies', a charming omnibus of four short films that celebrate the centenary year of Indian cinema. The stories, each roughly thirty minutes in duration, have no common link, except for a shared love and celebration of the movies. In Karan Johar's film, Rani Mukherjee and Randeep Hooda are an urban couple in a passionless marriage. A friendship with the new intern at her workplace (Saqib Saleem) leads to a disturbing revelation about Rani's relationship with her distant husband. Uncharacteristically mature for a film by Johar, and bristling with uncomfortable honesty, this story benefits from solid acting, sharp dialogue, and the fitting use of two evergreen Madan Mohan numbers. Despite its predictable resolution, the film is deeply affecting. Dibakar Banerjee's film, based on a short story by Satyajit Ray, stars the terrific Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a one-time theatre actor and failed entrepreneur seeking a job - any job - in an unforgiving city. When he strays into a film shoot one day and lands a bit part, he has a life-changing epiphany. Banerjee's film subtly weaves in the magic of cinema and the dedication of an artiste, while setting the story in the ordinariness of everyday life. The director's strength is in capturing real moments and it's accentuated in this achingly beautiful narrative. In Zoya Akhtar's story, a little boy (Naman Jain) finds his true calling in a darkened cinema hall, when he watches Katrina Kaif gyrate to Sheila ki jawaani. It's his indefinable connection to the actress that helps the boy understand that it's okay to chase his dream, however strange it may seem to everyone around him. Through this sweet story, Akhar also extracts touching performances from the kid and his older sister. Anurag Kashyap's ode to a cinematic legend ties up this omnibus neatly. His film is centered on a youth from Allahabad, Vijay (Vineet Kumar), seeking an audience with Amitabh Bachchan, determined to make the star taste his mother's murabba in a that he cradles carefully over days. Vijay camps outside Bachchan's house, just so he can fulfill his father's outlandish dream. Kashyap blends extraordinary comic touches with pathos, showing the love, the devotion reserved for a cinematic idol. And yet, here again, life plays an even bigger role than cinema, as seen in the film's interesting end. You may have a favorite amongst the four stories, because yes, this is cinema, and it touches different chords in different individuals. But there's no denying that 'Bombay Talkies' is a breath of fresh air - a wonderful gift to audiences on the 100th birthday of Indian cinema. I'm going with three and half out of five for 'Bombay Talkies'. Through four consummate storytellers, we're reminded just how much the movies mean to us.</Review>
      <Review Id="101" Name="Sukanya Verma" Expected="" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-bombay-talkies-is-an-engaging-ode-to-cinema/20130503.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="3rd May, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3.5/5">Hindi cinema is too voluminous a medium, and now a century old, to try encapsulating its glory in 25 quick minutes. At the same time, the broad appeal of silver screen and its gift to forge unique association with every single member of the audience is much widespread to ignore. And that*s the idea behind Bombay Talkies, a cinema anthology, directed by Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap. It*s not a comprehensive probe into the nearly-religious fervour for the movies or the innermost workings of showbiz. Instead what play out are four individualistic, intimate tributes by contemporary directors with a distinct approach to filmmaking. If Johar is known for glaze, Akhtar brings perspective; Banerjee*s narrative breaks new grounds whereas Kashyap scores in nuanced writing. Their skill sets vary. To be willingly adjudged for their combined creativity, fully aware comparisons lie ahead, regardless of the fact that all four films are completely dissimilar in content, tone and texture reflects inspiring maturity, faith in one*s self and a sense of, well, sportsmanship. Having said that, there*s a refreshing consistency in the intellectual aesthetics of all four shorts, it*s like a visual proof to the phrase *on the same page* and it*s not something frequent. One could complain, where*s the signature touch? But in collaboration, the closer they merge, the stronger they emerge. It certainly holds true for Karan Johar who begins with his offering, Ajeeb Dastan Hai Yeh. It*s not so much about moving away from one*s comfort zone as it is about testing one*s potential. It*s fabulous to witness him open up behind the camera like never before. There*s an exchange between two characters wherein one says, *You wanna come in?* To this the other responds, *You wanna come out?* This scene, for me, defines the first segment of the story. What is it about? Let*s just say it*s an exploration into the anxiety, politics and provocations of urban relationships. Where does the movie connect come? It*s subtle. Bollywood, here, is part of small talk, zany humour, sacrosanct ambiance or a fodder for amusing theories. A kid on the bridge sings Ajeeb dastan hai yeh (Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayee) and Lag ja gale (Woh Kaun Thi?). A music enthusiast*s study is filled with rare records and movie memorabilia. Or picking a favourite between Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit determines... er, you*ll have to book a ticket to find out. While a reserved Randeep Hooda and impudent Saqib Saleem articulate different kinds of intense, it*s Rani Mukerji*s flawless artistry as an imprisoned soul wearing a mark of normalcy, (even if you see those lovely freckles in all their splendour), which elevates the emotional core of Johar*s story and is its dignity and strength.   Speaking of strength, there*s tons of it on display in Dibakar Banerjee*s Star, which follows immediately after. Based on Satyajit Ray*s short story -- Patol Babu, Film Star, Star features Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a struggling actor residing in a rundown chawl who, more than anything else, wants to soar in the eyes of his daughter. Star, which celebrates the ties between opportunity and spirit, features an emu, a supporting cast of ladies with melting smiles, some sprightly assistant directors and a masterfully utilised Sadashiv Amrapurkar. And the camerawork by Nikos Andritsakis is simply brilliant in putting all of it across. Just that standalone moment with real cars rushing past a remote-controlled toy vehicle, their co-existence on an active street, is so mesmerising. Soon after the focus shifts on the figure controlling the remote, *Hum sirf bhai ko dekhta hai,* he dismissively responds when informed of a movie star shooting nearby. And in one brief moment, Banerjee conveys the veneration reserved for the superstar of the masses --Salman Khan. It*s tricky to discuss my favourite segment in Bombay Talkies without revealing too much. So I*ll just say this, even a 25-minute film can change the way you look at, the additions not extras, who fill the frames. Siddiqui*s rehearsal scene and the actual filming are moments that inspire, motivate and create a cinema worth paying tribute to, whether 100 or 10 years old. His Marathi is slightly rusty but when he excitedly divulges, *Tula mahiti hai papa ne aaj kai kela?* against the stirring score of Rabindranath Tagore*s song ---Tobu mone rekho, an accent seems too trivial a technicality to pit against his day*s achievement. After the feel-good Star, it*s Zoya Akhtar*s turn to enchant with Sheila Ki Jawani. When I saw the promos, I thought her portions resembled Sudipto Chattopadhyay*s Pankh but I couldn't be more wrong. As children, watching your mother get dressed up, especially the delicate art of applying lipstick, intrigues most of us. The only thing unusual here is that instead of a girl, it*s a little boy (Naman Jain) who shares this fascination. Pressurised by his well-meaning but stern father (Ranvir Shorey), he doesn't care for football and harbours Katrina-Kaif inspired dreams. One might try to read more than there is in this premise but there*s just no need. Kids indulge in all sorts of silliness. Not every action needs to be rummaged through for deeper undertones. Recall a similar plot in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna where Shah Rukh Khan disparages his son for picking music over sport. Akhtar, however, concentrates on the simple conflicts of childhood with dialogues that reflect their age, instead of the maker. So when one says, *Do you want to be an air hostess?* The profundity in the other*s reply is as straightforward as, *No I want to be a passenger.* The eventual pay off is reminiscent to Shashi Kapoor*s Bilva Mangal moment in Aag. Both the young members of the cast -- Naman Jain and Khushi Dubey do really well as a pair of siblings looking out for each other. Jain gets extra brownie points for those terrific moves in the segment*s spectacular even if simplistic climax. Anurag Kashyap*s tribute to cinema, Murraba is dedicated to Amitabh Bachchan. Personally, I found it the weakest of all the four films because its movement gets a bit repetitive after a while. Moreover, an overzealous Vineet Kumar as the Allahabad native fails to endear himself or gain sympathy in his fervent pursuit of Big B. His fixation is indirect so the hysterics don't register convincingly. There are some fine moments too. Despite all that build up, Kashyap doesn't compromise and turn the superstar into an accessible entity. He is used like an apparition, a believable, tangible apparition and he lets that aura remain. What I liked most was how he uses Mumbai, its people and how they survive on spunk and sense of humour without darkness taking over their being or livelihoods.   Bombay Talkies may or may not celebrate cinema in the direct sense. Except for its hopelessly tacky end-credits -- a complete waste of star power and resources, Bombay Talkies is an absorbing ode to the language of cinema that is part of our collective system. It honours the imagination and enthusiasm that attracts so many young men and women in this country to embrace a life of risk and rush * filmmaking.</Review>
      <Review Id="102" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/movie-review-bombay-talkies-fills-one-with-hope/1111033/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="6th May, 2013" Likes="16" Rating="3.5/5">One film. Four segments. And a great way to celebrate the centenary year of Indian cinema. Bombay Talkies is a film that gives you what all good films should: it has stories, it has emotion, and it has drama. It has people you want to know. You want to tap them on the shoulder, and ask, 'hey, you got a minute? Sit, talk to me.' Finally, Bombay Talkies fills you with hope. If Bollywood can make a film like this, then it must be doing something right. The strong connection that runs through all four is the love of movies. A character derives a life lesson from an evergreen film song. Another embarks on a journey to his holy grail, a legendary superstar. A drifter has an epiphany on a surreal film set. And a little boy begins his own search for self, via his favourite film star: did I say this film was about the movies? The most unexpected segment is the first, by Karan Johar. Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh is about a good looking but distant couple, the reason for which is revealed in a manner which takes the characters, and us, down a rocky, unsettling path. Rani Mukerji plays a tabloid journalist who favours low-cut blouses and cotton saris. Her husband (Randeep Hooda) is a TV presenter. Brash new entrant in this m?ge (Saqib Saleem) is quick to pick on the thread of dissatisfaction in his pretty colleague and her strangely disinterested spouse. What follows is quick and impactful, and leads to an affecting use of one of the most haunting Hindi movie songs, whose beauty refuses to be tamped by a couple of contrivances. The acting is good, the lines razor sharp and sexually charged: if it hadn't been for those tiny lapses, this would have been flawless. This is a Johar we haven't seen before, minimalist and real, not baroque and make-believe. And hard -hitting as opposed to airhead-fluffy. Come make more such movies, KJo. The second, based on a Satyajit Ray short story, Patol Babu, Film Star is the one that is full of surprises, and the one that is most satisfying. Dibakar Banerjee chooses Nawazuddin Siddiqui to play yet another ordinary man, trying to make a life in the hardscrabble belly of Mumbai. He wakes up with the sun in his eyes, and then he drifts, looking for something to do, for respect in his daughter's eyes, for relief in his wife's face : the only uncomplaining component in his life comes from a large bird. An emu in a chawl? The fact that you accept an exotic bird alongside this most unprepossessing fellow is a Dibakar triumph, as is this whole segment. It has Nawazuddin in yet another stellar performance, as he negotiates his way through an impromptu film set in a Mumbai street; it also brings back to the screen one of Hindi cinema's best actors, nearly forgotten now : Sadashiv Amrapurkar. Karan Johar's dastaan is wonderful, but this one, aptly called Star, made me sigh with pure, unvarnished pleasure. Not quite as novel or insightful is Anurag Kashyap's ode to Amitabh Bachchan and the insanity of the true fan. Vineet Singh, whom we've seen in Gangs Of Wasseypur plays Vijay from Allahabad, who is sent off on a mission to that other world-famous Vijay, formerly of Allahabad, now of Mumbai. The sender is his Babuji who claims to be mortally sick and who says he will hold on till the sendee, his son, returns after that chora ganga kinarewala has partaken a bite of some home-made murabba. Murabba has its moments, especially when Vijay first asks, the artlessness done just so: aap bhi Allahabad se hain ka bhaiyya? This is Kashyap's territory and he is spot on with the lingo and the leheja, but the exchanges between Singh and the guards guarding Bachchan's house become repetitive, and flatten the tale. The idol's appearance is deftly done, though. Bachchan, in that single flash, is played just right, and Singh has again left me wanting to see more of him. A little boy earns his square father's (Shorey) ire because he hates football and likes girly stuff in Zoya Akhtar's Sheila Ki Jawaani. He loves dancing. He also loves Katrina Kaif. How Kaif and her shimmy-shake-shake comes to his, and his sister's rescue forms the rest of it. The children are both natural and endearing, particularly the young boy (Jain), but this one doesn't wholly satisfy either, and not just because the sight of little kids bumping and grinding to Bollywood item numbers is discomfiting. It's more because this conventional father- not wanting to stick to the prescribed masculine path son is a familiar trope. The smart closing ploy makes up for it somewhat : bright-eyed kids pushing past their parents' hidebound ideas, and forging ahead are always going to be a win. Bombay Talkies speaks of you and me, and speaks to you and me. Not all segments are even, but they are all cracklingly real. So much like life, isn't it?</Review>

Not in one film with four short stories, it is simply too complex. But when four of the brightest filmmaking brains of GenNow come together to capture the frenzy that drives popular culture in India, the attempt has to be special. Look beyond the mandatory tribute item frill featuring 20 top stars, and Bombay Talkies - Bollywood's toast to the 100 years of Indian cinema - is doff of the hat to the common cine-lover who drives the biggest industry in the world. It is an album of celluloid that tries understanding how cinema regulates dreams, passions, hope, despair, joy and sorrow in this country. The film is impressive for the thought process gone behind each story in the anthology. Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar may belong to different schools but have one thing in common - they are efficient storytellers. Bombay Talkies thrives for the way its creative brains bring out the essence of its subject. Each story picks a different slice of life. The film starts off with Karan Johar's tale about a journalist couple (Rani Mukerji and Randeep Hooda), seemingly happy. Turmoil creeps into their home by way of a junior colleague of hers (Saqib Saleem), who is gay. K.Jo delivers a surprise punch of realism despite retaining trademark melodrama and lets a talented cast make most of well-penned characters. The film beautifully hails the power of Bollywood music to stir emotions, at the same time making its point about social taboo over sexual orientation. Dibakar Banerjee's short unleashes Nawazuddin Siddiqui at his glorious best. Based on a Satyajit Ray story titled Potol Babu Filmstar, the segment casts Nawaz as a struggling actor trying to keep his bedridden daughter happy with tales about filmstars. He gets the story of his life to tell her one day, with the chance to do one scene in a film with Ranbir Kapoor. Dibakar has crafted an unforgettable film. The most enchanting tale comes from Zoya Akhtar. Her film is about a kid (Naman Jain) obsessed with superstar diva Katrina Kaif. Dad (Ranvir Shorey) wants him to play football, to be tough, but the kid loves dancing. Fantasy blends with reality to let Katrina, gorgeous as only she can be, appear as herself in the boy's imagination. Straight off the TV interview he is watching, to leave a vital message. Zoya has given a stunner that operates at multiple levels. On a simple note, the film makes a point about parents forcing their dreams on children. Importantly, her story is a strong psychological snapshot on the impact that filmy passion has on the impressionable mind which, if moulded rightly, can actually be a good thing. Ironic wit throbs all through Anurag Kashyap's whopper of a finale, about a young man (Vineet Kumar) in Benaras who sets off to meet Amitabh Bachchan to fulfil a wish of his ailing father. Anurag gives a fitting tribute to the small-town fan whose aspirations are driven by the larger-than-life Bollywood hero, typified here by the magic of Big B. This is Anurag at his best, succinctly defining what superstar madness is all about. Bombay Talkies lets us celebrate ourselves as viewers. It leaves a warm afterglow reminding us that cinema in India flourished thanks to its audience. Bollywood in its 100th year has given fans a nice gift.</Review>

The primary point of interest was inevitably focussed on how each filmmaker would interpret the medium that has defined Indian popular culture for a hundred years. Bombay Talkies serves its principal purpose quite well: each segment of this cinematic anthology underscores in bold relief the defining creative impulses of its maker. To that extent, Bombay Talkies springs no surprises at all. You get more or less what you expect. Karan Johar, in the opening segment, stays put in his comfort zone * in the world of a yuppie couple (Rani Mukherji, entertainment supplement editor; and Randeep Hooda, TV news anchor) and a spunky gay rebel (Saqib Saleem) who turns their married life on its head. At the other end of the spectrum, in the fourth short film, Anurag Kashyap settles for a characteristically cheeky, earthy and breezy style in telling the story of an Allahabad man (Vineet Kumar Singh) who sets out on an improbable mission to meet his dad*s movie idol, Amitabh Bachchan, and give the superstar a taste of home-made murabba. Similarly, while Zoya Akhtar cannot quite break free from the lure of a Bollywood diva (Katrina Kaif) even as she comes up with the unconventional tale of a boy (Naman Jain) who aspires to be a girl, Dibakar Banerjee gives full rein to what he is good at * capturing the joys and despairs of *that little man* in the crowd (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Each segment of Bombay Talkies has its moments, either in terms of the quality of the acting or in the little narrative sleights that hit home. What is disappointing is that, barring the Dibakar Banerjee segment, none of the films is an attempt to showcase cinema as a self-contained medium of expression. They only explore its external manifestations. Two of the segments * Zoya Akhtar*s and Anurag Kashyap*s * are about the dynamics of movie stardom and how it exercises a hold on the lives of common people. Karan Johar*s story, essentially a relationship drama bolstered by fine performances, establishes no more than a fleeting linkage with the movies through a pair of classic 1960s Lata Mangeshkar numbers (Ajeeb dastaan hai yeh kahaan shuru kahaan khatam and Lag jaa gale ki phir yeh haseen raat ho na ho) that a girl on a railway station footbridge sings for a few tokens of appreciation from passerby. Despite the obvious stylistic divergences, all the four stories dwell upon lies and truths, and make-believe and struggles to escape the drudgery of real life. But is that all there is to this amazingly multifaceted medium? The fact that cinema is the youngest and the most modern of art forms forever changing shape and constantly evolving is eloquently underlined by lyricist Swanand Kirkire in the film*s lively musical prelude, Lo aaya aaya aaya main hoon movie madaari. But that spirit isn't wholly reflected in the films that follow. To their credit, in the end credits or anywhere else, the filmmakers do not make the claim that Bombay Talkies is a tribute to one hundred years of Indian cinema as a whole. As the title suggests, the film recognizes only a single strand of the vast diversity that the cinema of this vast subcontinent represents and stops at *celebrating 100 years of cinema in our lives*. It is only Banerjee*s short film that seeks to penetrate the heart of the raconteur*s art through the dawn-to-nightfall story of an ordinary man who stumbles upon extraordinary magic in his life, if only for a brief moment, when he strays into a film shoot after a failed job hunt and is roped in for a bit part. Loosely adapted from a short story by Satyajit Ray (Potol Babu, Film Star), the film is set in a soul-sapping Mumbai where a one-time folk actor from Sangli cannot even find the inspiration to create a simple story that can perk up his listless young daughter. When the man does rediscover his inner self, Dibakar Banerjee and his lead actor, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, turn the last few minutes of the segment into an exhilarating exhibition of the pure joy of mime and music, extracting every ounce of energy from silent hand and body gestures as the father transmits the excitement of the moment to his entranced daughter. The scene plays out to the accompaniment of a soulful instrumental rendition of a lilting Tagore song (Tobu mone rekho), which roughly translates as *even so, remember me if I stray far away; remember me even if old love is suppressed by the mesh of a new affection*. Nostalgia, poignance and the depth of the human imagination all gently spring forth from this construct * it becomes a perfect summation of the magic of storytelling and instantly imprints itself on the mind. Nawazuddin is a marvel, a master of mimetic minimalism. Such moments of epiphany are rare in Bombay Talkies. One is left with the feeling that a once-in-a-century cinematic experiment should have had more heart and heft. But do not let that put you off. In encapsulating the dreams, disappointments, falsehoods, flashes of truth, elements of emotional artifice and inescapable realities of life, these four stories, each distinct in emotional timbre and visual feel, do present, within their limited ambit, a range of cinematic expressions that are in themselves laudable.</Review>

Loving families, skin-tight genders, glittering stardom and happy endings get tossed about by the four directors here. Does this work? Yes - and no. Straight up, Karan Johar's film smashes his own mould - forget about loving your parents, Johar shows a gay youth Avinash (Saqib Saleem) pummeling his father while quitting home. Avinash befriends glamorous Gayatri (Rani), wife to Dev (Hooda) with whom she has passionless, infrequent sex. Avinash meets Dev - sparks fly. While Saqib convincingly portrays odd-ball Avinash, Hooda simmers with tangible tension. It all ends in tears, delightful coming from the archetype of extra cheese himself. This is Karan Johar unleashed - and impressive with his taut film. He's followed by Dibakar Bannerjee, adapting a Satyajit Ray story, featuring Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Purandhar, dreamer with a theatrical past - and a tiny Bollywood role. Dibakar quietly underlines how talent needn't dazzle the world but simply please the people we love. Siddiqui and Amrapurkar - popping up in a vision - crackle while Nawaz's act sans words is superb. However, elements like an emu are lost in translation, leaving you wanting less whimsy, more control. Zoya Akhtar presents better balance. Little Vicky (Naman) loves being a girly dancer. Katrina Kaif's his muse - his manly dad isn't amused. This unpretentious flick explores childhood's innocence facing magical, kitschy stars. There's some meandering but tight acting makes up. That isn't so with Anurag Kashyap's short from stereotypically scatological small-town-land. Vijay from Allahabad must have Amitabh Bachchan taste a (possibly fungal) murabba to please pitaji - he succeeds but fails. The trouble is, neither the dialogues nor the acting move you enough to care. Kashyap indulges himself and eulogizes the Big B - but also has chota shehris looking pretty banal. On the upside, BT's best song amidst a lackluster score's here - but there's too much sugar for this short to stay crisp. So, BT's a good experiment, celebrating movies, mindsets and Mumbai's moods - but it isn't the coolest film doing so. Woh picture abhi baaqi hai, mere dost.</Review>

What's best, you may not like the Doordarshan-ish promotional video having an ensemble of Hindi cinema's superstars towards the end but it's the sheer reverence for cinema that'll make you enjoy it anyway! That's our four filmmakers', Karan Johar, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Bannerjee and Anurag Kashyap's way of celebrating the centenary of Indian cinema as their quarter Bombay Talkies makes it to the cinema halls today. 1 - The film opens with Karan Johar's segment showcasing a perfect world, a good looking couple Gayatri (Rani Mukerji) and Dev (Randeep Hooda) comfortably settled in their married life. Gayatri is the managing editor of an entertain tabloid where she comes across a young intern at her office Avinash (Saqib Saleem) who soon befriends her and gets privy to her intimate details of her married life that's now turned mundane and passionless. The ebullient homosexual Avinash in one meeting with Dev starts deciphering the reasons for the developing cracks in their marriage. Although the tabooed topic of homosexuality and coming out of the closet is increasingly finding its place in Hindi film stories, it's pleasantly surprising to see Johar breaking the stereotypical mould of the family sagas and keeping his film as realistic as possible. He weaves the story with the lilting song selections of Ajeeb dastan hai yeh and Lag jaa gale running along with the narrative at the background. The film's predictability gets covered up by the impressive acting by Randeep, Rani and Saqib and the brilliant dialogue writing. 2 - The next one and what would be the cinematically the best in terms of cinematography, editing and narrating is Dibakar Bannerjee's film. Adapting a Satyajit Ray story (Potol Babu), Bannerjee reveals a troubled past of Purandhar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and his mentor (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) which affects his present too. Hailing from a seedy chawl in Mumbai, Purandhar, chances upon a scene along with Ranbir Kapoor in a big Bollywood film as an extra. How within a few minutes of rehearsals, the filmmaker introduces a dream sequence with a dramatic confrontation between Purandhar and his mentor is what follows through the rest of the plot. Dibakar taps the acting prowess of Nawazuddin Siddiqui who is at the top of his form and presents a poignant yet endearing film that tugs at your heart straight away. Even a brief cameo of Sadashiv Amrapukar is extremely impactful and stays with you right till the end. Cinematographer Nikos Andritsakis' camera adds gems to this brilliant story with each and every frame standing out. A special mention to the wide framing of the open space surrounded by urban skyscrapers which has the miniscule Nawaz rehearsing his bit role in the film and also the dramatic sequence of Nawaz and Amrapukar with the pet emu lurking quirkily at the backdrop. 3 - Zoya Akhtar's story, arguably the weakest of the lot, traces the story of a 12 year old kid Vicky (Naman Jain) who's smitten by the latka-jhatkas of Bollywood and completely swooned by Sheila - Katrina Kaif. He literally worships the actress and wants to be a dancer just like her. But his dreams always get severely rebuked by his stern father (Ranvir Shorey) who wants his son to behave like a boy and indulges him in playing football and cricket. Although the child actor plays his part splendidly but the inner turmoil and conflict doesn't get dealt properly by Akhtar. The message too that the film wants to convey appears blurry. 4 - The last and the second most delightful of the lot is Anurag Kashyap's tale of Murabba (Pickle). It can be called Kashyap's homage to the blind star worship that happens in the Bollywood crazed Nation with the star of course being - Amitabh Bachchan. Vijay (Vineet Kumar Singh) from Allahabad takes on a journey to Mumbai to fulfill his aging father's (Sudhir Pandey) last wish of sharing a murabba with his favourite star Amitabh Bachchan. What he considers to be a 2minute job turns into an unending mayhem. Anurag's story stands strongly not so much on the story as on the witty street slangs and the myriad emotions it portrays. The portions of Mr. Bachchan's cameo and the subsequent turn of events really get you glued to the screens. Bombay Talkies is not so much homage to 100 years completion of Indian cinema than the celebration of the varied genres of cinema. It celebrates the cinema frenzied fans of the nation in a befitting manner. With each story better than the other, Bombay Talkies is a sure shot watch.</Review>
      <Review Id="107" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/588998" Affiliation="bollywoodhungama.com" Date="1st May, 2013" Likes="395" Rating="4/5">It's a fact... Cinema and cricket are pursued with religious fervor in India. Cinema connects us. Cinema unites us. Cinema is indeed the predominant influence on our lives. Cinema is, without doubt, an integral part of every movie lover... Indian cinema, which completes its 100th year this year [RAJA HARISHCHANDRA, the first full-length feature-film made by Dadasaheb Phalke, was released in 1913], ought to be commemorated. What better way than four avant garde film-makers combining forces to pay respect to cinema -- Karan Johar, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Anurag Kashyap. Backed by Viacom18, the four prolific film-makers set out to narrate stories that are unconventional, borrowed from real life, about the common man. Also, each of those stories has a reference to Indian cinema/stars. The four stories in BOMBAY TALKIES -- made at a stipulated budget of Rs 1.5 cr each, the duration not exceeding 20/25 minutes -- are entwined in one film. Of course, experiments like this, when one or multiple raconteurs join hands to narrate distinctive stories, aren't new. Recall DARNA MANA HAI [2003; Prawaal Raman narrated a series of six stories in one film], DARNA ZAROORI HAI [2006; seven directors narrating seven different stories], SALAAM-E-ISHQ [2007; six love stories helmed by Nikhil Advani] and DUS KAHANIYAAN [2007; ten stories narrated by six directors]... A film like BOMBAY TALKIES gives an opportunity to film-makers to step out of their comfort zone and try to create something novel. It's a podium that does not necessarily cater to the box-office or the diaspora alone. Also, it helps the film-maker to tap the latent talent that he/she possesses, but it's never nurtured due to commercial constraints. The challenge lies in not merely narrating a story within a budget, but also narrating a tale effectively encompassing myriad emotions... Karan Johar Plot: All's well between an urban couple [Randeep Hooda, Rani Mukerji] till the wife meets a colleague [Saqib Saleem] at work. It changes their lives forever. Think of Karan Johar and you can't help but recall larger than life movies, music, dances, emotions, drama, grandiose sets, stunning locales, chic outfits* But Karan does an about-turn with the story in BOMBAY TALKIES. Of course, in films like KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA and MY NAME IS KHAN, Karan did make an attempt to push the envelope, but with the short story in BOMBAY TALKIES, he narrates a story that no film-maker has endeavored to narrate on the Hindi screen. I was in a state of disbelief because I never expected Karan to narrate an account with such flourish in those 20 odd minutes. Karan reinvents himself here! The story revolves around three characters and each of them delivers bravura performances. Rani is efficient, as always. Randeep is finally getting the characters that do justice to his talent. But it is Saqib Saleem who stuns you with a dazzling performance. Kudos to Karan for taking a giant leap as a storyteller and depicting a harsh reality with brilliance! Dibakar Banerjee Plot: An actor [Nawazuddin Siddiqui] is struggling to make a living. While watching a film shoot one day, he gets an opportunity that helps him prove himself to his daughter. Based on Satyajit Ray's short story 'Patol Babu, Film Star', Dibakar changes the setting from middle class Kolkata to middle class Dadar in Mumbai. With this story, Dibakar attempts to underline the actuality that personal contentment cannot be weighed against monetary incentives. In the end, the contentment on Nawaz's face, his body language as he narrates a story to his daughter, the cheerfulness he radiates seems so bona fide. You must hand it to Dibakar for transporting to the fore a story that makes you reflect on the various decisions of your past. There are two vital performers in this story -- Nawazuddin and Sadashiv Amrapurkar. Nawazuddin is brilliant all through, specifically in the sequence when he rushes home to his daughter to narrate a new story. It's indeed a pleasure to watch the supremely talented Sadashiv Amrapurkar after a hiatus. Anurag Kashyap Plot: A young man [Vineet Kumar Singh] arrives in Mumbai from Allahabad to fulfill his ailing father's [Sudhir Pande] last wish. Anurag is known for pushing the boundaries, for thinking out of the box, for swimming against the tide* most importantly, he's known for encouraging new, deserving talent. Anurag too does an about-turn and makes a film that's in sharp contrast to the 'dark films' he's synonymous with. The story he narrates evokes myriad emotions -- it makes you chuckle, it makes you feel sympathetic towards the millions of hopeful who arrive in the city, it makes you moist-eyed when something drastic transpires during the train journey. With this film, Anurag should silence the naysayers who feel he restricts himself to confined themes only. Vineet Kumar Singh is a talent to watch out for. The vulnerability of an outsider when he arrives in a metropolis like Mumbai is projected radiantly by this young actor. Sudhir Pande is first-rate. But it is Amitabh Bachchan's super cameo that adjoins credence to the sequence of events. Zoya Akhtar Plot: A kid [Naman Jain] from a middle class family is captivated by an actress [Katrina Kaif]. He decides to break the rules of the society and chase his dreams. Parents who thrust their condescending ambitions on their kids are not new for Bollywood. Zoya tackled a similar plot in LUCK BY CHANCE [recall Dimple Kapadia's character]. Now Zoya drives home a pertinent message through a kid here. The middle class setting, the defenselessness of the kids, the dilemma when parents decide what their kids ought to be when they grow up* Zoya's handling of the delicate moments stay with you. The usage of 'My Name Is Sheela' [from TEES MAAR KHAN] is the icing on the cake and the kid's moves are amazing. While Ranvir Shorey enacts the part of the disciplinarian father to perfection, it's the performance of the two kids -- Naman and Khushi Dubey -- that are most rewarding. Naman in particular is the star of the story. Katrina Kaif appears in a sparkling cameo. The film concludes with a tribute to Indian cinema, which brings as many as twenty top stars together on the same platform [choreography: Vaibhavi Merchant]. On the whole, BOMBAY TALKIES is one of those infrequent movies wherein you get to eyeball the superior efforts of four top notch film-makers in less than two hours. This reality alone makes the film a compelling watch, while the superior performances and absorbing themes that the movie prides itself in only serve as an icing on the cake. This celebration of cinema is a must watch!</Review>

Maybe just a sliver of the truth. You simplify, romanticize and gloss over what*s unpalatable about your subject*distilling a kind of agreeable net worth. The romanticizing is perhaps bound to be more pronounced if the subject is one of your own. Most of Bombay Talkies, four miniatures by directors Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap, meant to commemorate 100 years of Hindi cinema, is that stereotypical tribute. There is warm-hearted humour and a playful, anodyne gaze at Hindi cinema*s power and role in the life of India, largely Mumbai. They don't question its workings or provoke strong reactions on its hyper-presence in our life. More disappointing, none of the stories have a personal stamp*in aesthetics or point of view. Johar*s film is about a couple, a journalist who edits an entertainment tabloid (Rani Mukerji) and a television news anchor (Randeep Hooda) whose marriage is bereft of intimacy. A young intern at her office, who abruptly becomes her best friend, scratches the surface of this relationship, and secrets emerge. Johar*s confused and abrasive lead character is a connoissuer and collector of vintage Hindi film music and has a room in his house, stacked with LPs and memorabilia. Here, he misses an opportunity to discover new love. Two of Lata Mangeshkar*s most popular and exquisite songs, Ajeeb dastan hai yeh and Lag jaa gale, accentuate the narrative. The lead performances lift the narrative above its predictable curve and earnest tone*both Mukerji and Hooda make the most of every scene they have without going overboard with the histrionics. This is Johar*s most mature, if sentimental, look at homosexuality. Hindi cinema is a tertiary flourish in his story. photo Nawazuddin Siddiqui Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays a thwarted actor with a troubled past with his mentor and a difficult present in Banerjee*s story*the most cinematic of all the films. Storytelling, cinematography, music, editing and acting are in meaningful synthesis. Siddiqui lives in a chawl in Mumbai with his wife and a bedridden, depressed daughter. He tells her stories about Bollywood and the Bollywood stars he meets while trying to find work in the film industry. In an absurdist twist, Banerjee introduces a gawky emu into this congested and loud chawl milieu. The emu is a reminder of one of his failed projects but has become his pet. One day, he is chosen randomly for an extra*s role on a film shoot. Within that span of a few minutes, he questions himself and his dreams. Sadashiv Amrapurkar has an engaging cameo. Siddiqui is at his peak of acting prowess. In Banerjee*s direction and writing, pathos and humour intermingle, and Siddiqui brings out the character*s fine print without the crutch of lines. It is safe to say that Siddiqui is today*s most engrossing acting talent in Hindi films. Nikos Andritsakis* cinematography produces some gems, including a surreal sequence in which the actor shakily rehearses his blink-and-miss role in an open space surrounded by glass high-rises. Under a scorching sun, he meets an old man and an emu. Indisputably, the best-executed story in Bombay Talkies. photo Naman Jain Akhtar*s protagonist is a boy (Naman Jain) in love with jhatak-matak Bollywood. He wants to doll up and dance to film songs. Katrina Kaif worship leads him to a hallucinatory life lesson. His tyrannical father (Ranvir Shorey), of course, wants him to toughen up by playing football and cricket. Jain is adorable as the conflicted boy. The art direction is authentic and Akhtar*s forte, her ability to work with actors, and a charming climax somewhat make up for the thin story. photo Vineet Kumar Singh An Allahabad boy*s travails outside Prateeksha, the most famous Bollywood address, is the subject of Anurag Kashyap*s story. He looks at hero worship through a father-son duo in Allahabad. The ageing father*s (Sudhir Pandey) last wish is to share a murabba (pickled Indian gooseberry), a traditional UP kitchen staple, with his hero Amitabh Bachchan. The son (Vineet Kumar Singh) arrives in Mumbai with the bottle carrying the murabba and embarks on a mission. Kashyap*s writing crackles. The dialogues and the humour are sharp. The story is a full-throttle ode to Bachchan*with a song, a cameo by the superstar and a fairly convincing portrait of Bachchan-worship in Mumbai. The house, Prateeksha, is a metaphor for all that is desirable and daunting about Bollywood. Bombay Talkies is set to excellent music by Amit Trivedi and while they unfold, the stories hold up in their half-hour individual length. But after you have left the theatre, it is not gratification you feel, but the short-lived aftertaste of a music video or a good commercial. It eulogizes Bollywood, sure, but in a Bollywood-crazy nation it is like preaching to the converted. Surely there is more to the desire, madness, ugliness and fantasy in Hindi cinema, and to the millions who work here. If you wait to watch the terrible promotional video at the end of the film, satrring all our stars, you will most likely forget the best of Bombay Talkies.</Review>

The ultimate test of its rationale is whether it is good enough to raise the hairs on the back on your neck.* The good news is that Ek Thi Daayan, co-produced by Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj, manages that. The bad news is that the film only manages that in the first half. Until the interval, debutant director Kannan Iyer had me pinned to my seat.  Of course, first I had to get over the fact that the hero in this film, played by Emraan Hashmi, is called Bobo. He*s a magician, so people refer to him as Bobo the Baffler. Bobo starts to suffer from hallucinations. He undergoes hypnosis and discovers that in his childhood, he was terrorised by a woman named Diana, played by Konkona Sen Sharma, who may or may not have been a Daayan * that*s Hindi for witch. Kannan seamlessly transposes a rural old wives* tale into an urban setting. The building lift becomes a passage to hell. But the screenplay by Mukul Sharma and Bhardwaj maintains an eerie ambiguity. Is the young Bobo, played very well by Vishesh Tiwari, simply over-reacting to the new woman in his widower father*s life or is she actually a murderous witch? There are moments here that made me jump. Konkona is deliciously wicked and at one point, I got so spooked that I closed my eyes. And then, the curse of the second half struck like a gale-force. Kalki Koechlin, playing Lisa Dutt, makes an entry. She*s an interesting actor but the film doesn't know what to do with her. The pace slackens, the plot unravels and Kannan*s assured grip on the material loosens. By the climax, Ek Thi Daayan descends into Vikram Bhatt territory * the plot doesn't stay true even to its own logic. It*s cheesy and simply too silly to scare. Which is a real bummer because until then, I was having a lot of fun. Ek Thi Daayan had the potential to be an A-grade horror film but it*s an opportunity lost. However, I would love to see Diana get her own film and I*m very curious about what Kannan will do next.</Review>

But where 'Makdee' was an old-fashioned fable about a village witch who supposedly turned humans into animals, 'Daayan', set in the modern, urban world, is intended as an eerie supernatural thriller. First-time director Kannan Iyer sets up the film nicely, introducing us to our protagonist Bobo (Emraan Hashmi), who appears to have everything - a successful career as a magician, a supportive fianc? Tamra (Huma Qureshi), and even a young boy they have chosen to adopt. Yet, Bobo is haunted by hallucinations of his dead sister. When he delves into his past through hypnosis, he must confront his memories of the mysterious woman, Diana (Konkona Sen Sharma), who was hired to babysit his sister and him as kids. Iyer does a good job of conveying the curious, suspicious nature of an eleven-year-old obsessed with the idea of the dark side. When Diana enters their lives, all young Bobo needs is a clue to confirm his theory, and Konkona plays up the intrigue deliciously. Back in the present day, just when Bobo appears to have shut out the past, another mysterious woman, Lisa Dutt (Kalki Koechlin), enters his life. Bobo insists she's a witch, but Tamra befriends Lisa and convinces him otherwise. The film's USP is co-writers Vishal Bhardwaj and Mukul Sharma's decision to transport the folklore of witches to the heart of a modern-day story. Young Bobo believes that hell exists at the bottom of his building, and he's constantly trying to program the lift into travelling all the way down below the ground floor where mean neighbours, evil stepmothers and khadoos watchmen have been banished. There's potential in the premise that your nanny, or the woman buying your flat, could be hiding a sinister secret. But alas, the film reveals its chinks in the final act when it arrives at an underwhelming climax involving such clich?as child sacrifice and particularly a human-versus-evil forces face-off that seems straight out of a bad Vikram Bhatt movie, complete with laughable special effects. The "big twist" is easy to predict, and the film's message so pat, you can't help rolling your eyes the moment it's delivered. In the thrills department, 'Daayan' packs one or two effective jump-in-your seat moments, but for the most part it cruises along on the strength of its suspense alone. Emraan Hashmi gives a nicely contained performance, never going into ham-and-cheese mode as the paranoid protagonist. A word also for Vishesh Tiwari who leaves a lasting impression as yo</Review>

Because that's where the dark things live. Because that's where the fears are. A benevolent glance switching to sudden, startling malevolence. An empty room with murderous corners. An eyeball turning dense black. Ek Thi Daayan starts so well that you are riveted. Just about everything in the first half, with its well-calibrated chills, is just as it should be. The second half is unravel time, and you are then left grasping at thin air. Quite appropriate, in a film about magic and apparitions, and witches, and, yes, daayans. The sharp slide wants to make you ask, what just happened here, did a black cat cross the path of the film? Bobo (Hashmi) is a conjurer. He is in the middle of a show when something strange happens on stage, leaving him shaking. A visit to a shrink who has known him since childhood leads him back to his tragic past, in which his father and little sister died, the scars of which he hasn't managed to shake off. The cause, as we are shown through young Bobo's eyes, is a daayan, who seduces his father (Malhotra, solid as ever), and befriends his little sister, for the express purpose of taking lives. Now Bobo is older, and is finally ready to get rid of his ghastly memories. But daayans don't give up their prey so easily, it seems. The disturbing visions begin again. People close to him are threatened, and the daayan with the "long plait which has all her strength" and the "arms longer than their bodies" is back. The skill with which the story is built up, in a flat full of atmospherics, eschewing horror clich?helps us get past the hokeyness of the daayan premise. If daayans and their deeds are so entertaining, I said to myself at the interval, bring them on. The disappointment begins with a mehndi-shaadi song. Why, why? The writing becomes obvious, the surprises disappear, and the big reveal is such a mash-up of so many previous spookfests that Ek Thi Daayan becomes more 'Kab Hogi Khatam'. But while the going is good, so much about this film is so good. There really is no one like Vishal Bhardwaj (who's co-produced the film with Ekta Kapoor), who can paint such a natural picture of childhood; debutant director Kannan Iyer could easily have plucked the kids out of Bhardwaj's imagination * the children are real, their conversation is natural, and their fears are palpable. Konkona Sen Sharma resurfaces after a gap, and what a super act she's come up with. She crept me out nicely. Huma Qureshi has just a few good moments, but makes the most of them. Also, dear Bollywood leading ladies, please watch Kalki Koechlin strum a guitar and sing, to know how it is done: that Yaaram song is the only thing that kept the post-interval bit afloat. That, and Emraan's consistency with his part: this is a performer who keeps getting better. Ek Thi Daayan starts out as a well-acted, well-produced supernatural thriller, which could , and should, have climaxed with a knock-out punch. To which end, somebody should have walked across the wrap with a deft pair of webbed feet.</Review>
      <Review Id="112" Name="Vinakayk Chakravorty" Expected="" Link="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/movie-review-ek-thi-daayan/1/266641.html" Affiliation="Indiatoday" Date="19th April, 2013" Likes="143" Rating="3/5">A little bit of magic is what you expect anyway when Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj co-produce a film. Ek Thi Daayan throws in a lot of it, though there seems room left for a little more. Impressively though, this is the most unusual Bollywood horror film you might have seen. Kannan Iyer's debut directorial feature is special also for another reason. Daayans and their inteqaam ditties have mostly been staple yarn for C-grade Bollywood. Ek Thi Daayan is a bid to tweak the genre for the discerning crowd, with a psychological subtext. Before anything, don't be swayed by claims that the film is regressive and presents women in a bad light - as certain sections seem to have done without even watching it. Iyer has made an out-and-out thriller that cocktails romance with horror and in no way demeans the better half of society or promotes superstition. The film is eerie overall and genuinely scary in parts without playing to the gallery. Emraan Hashmi is cast as Bobo the magician, whose life seems to be falling apart. Although he has a sweet girlfriend (Huma Qureshi) and a seemingly content life, he can't rid himself of hallucinations that continually plague him. Psychiatric help involves regression hypnosis. As Bobo's past comes alive through his memories, we get to know of his discomfort as a child over his stepmother (Konkona Sen Sharma). He talks of a daayan that had wrecked their home. When the charming Lisa Dutt (Kalki Koechlin), enters his life, Bobo is somehow convinced she could be the daayan from the past. The build-up of the script (Vishal and Mukul Sharma) in the first half is superb. Smart twists prop the fear factor to constantly tease you. It all leaves a hint that Bobo's tale is not as simple as it originally seemed. Director Iyer throws in an underplayed love track between Emraan and Huma to balance out the chills. Post-interval, though, the film starts losing pace. While the impish twist at the end is a winner, it unfolds only after a lazy second half has tested your patience. What works for the film, though, is its intention. It isn't peddling superstitious. Rather, Iyer delves into the recesses of the human mind to craft a dark thriller that regales. Emraan Hashmi strikes a chord as a successful guy battling personal crisis. He brings out Bobo's obsession about witchcraft well. The three heroines add to the scare quotient, bringing alive complex characters with due screen presence. Ek Thi Daayan is a different flavour for horror lovers. It takes the genre a step forward with differently-imagined creativity. Watch it if you love your goosebumps served wry.</Review>
      <Review Id="113" Name="Raja Sen" Expected="" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-ek-thi-daayan-is-impressively-scary/20130419.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="19th April, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">I never quite understood that old saying about witches having feet the other way around. Does it mean that their feet are backwards (toes to back, heel to front) or does it mean that the left foot is in place of right foot, like hurriedly discarded flip-flops? Not knowing specifics, however, didn't keep me from knowing the lore. The supernatural fascinates us all, with children often more drawn to the ideas of the fantastical because they gullibly (and willingly) believe, yes, but also because they are steered away from dark and morbid imagery, imagery deemed inappropriate for them. So naturally it becomes something worth eavesdropping, whispering, finding out about. Kannan Iyer*s Ek Thi Daayan, based on a short story by Mukul Sharma, avoids the usual set of Bollywood cliches about tanktriks and shraaps -- all that bhootiyapa, if I may -- to introduce us to fear through a child*s eyes. The line, between what we actually believe and what is conjured up by the feverish imagination of a young boy desperate to believe in legends, is blurred very effectively, and that is what makes this film so cleverly creepy, so intelligently eerie. It is, in many ways, a children*s film populated with grown-up scares. And for this originality it deserves applause. The mood is set with the opening disclaimer, one that assures us that the film isn't intended to promote witchcraft. Okay then. The opening credits are seriously old-school, bassnotes thumping through faded green images of Bombay with Rekha Bhardwaj singing a song that wouldn't be out of place in Mahal. Emraan Hashmi plays Bobo The Baffler, a highly successful stage magician in this fictionalised version of India where stage magicians can actually be successful. Like I said, old-school. He*s a spiffy enough conjuror -- one of his big tricks even involves a switch between twins, as seen in Christopher Nolan*s The Prestige -- but visions of his past peskily get in the way. It is a traumatised past, he concedes to his girlfriend sketchily, before confiding in a hypnotherapist instead. This leads us to a flashback which lasts through the first half of the film, and makes for pretty riveting cinema. We first meet young Bobo aged around 10, in checked trousers and with an Afro. His kid sister, Misha, is hopefully devoted to him. Their names sound like they*ve come straight out of a Russian children*s book, and their story is as intriguing: Bobo pores over an old leathery tome about witchcraft and is convinced their elevator is haunted, and Misha laps up everything he says. Their single father hasn't yet, to the children*s delight, gotten them a stepmom. (*Do all stepmoms have to be evil?,* asks Misha. *They can be good,* Bobo concedes, *But they aren't.*) Except one day the father meets a young lady in the lift, gives her a lift, and soon enough the stepmom void is filled. This entire first-half -- while sounding like a great backstory for an over-committed barber with highly fetishised ponytail-hatred -- is excellent. The narrative is constant, thrilling and filled with tiny detailing, supported by uniformly great acting and sharp, neat writing. Hashmi is remarkably comfortable in his own skin and plays the role of an inevitable loner with a compelling masochism. He is the kind of man who will switch the lights off despite being spooked by shadows, and the kind of man women with long-tresses would do well to keep away from. Especially when he has a butter-knife within reach. The three leading ladies -- Konkona Sen Sharma, Huma Qureshi and Kalki Koechlin -- are smashing in their roles, and I refuse here to tell you who plays who. Each plays their given role with frighteningly good flair, and each deserves a big hand. Much of that applause is justifiably stolen by little Visshesh Tiwari as the young Bobo, while Sara Arjun*s Misha is irresistibly cute. And, as is the norm, Pawan Malhotra (as the father) and Rajatava Dutta (as the whiskey-swilling, tennis playing shrink) are top-notch. Cinematographer Saurabh Goswami is challenged by a film that lives too much in the dark, but aside from an occasionally too-shaky camera, he manages much artful framing (my favourite moment is when the kids high-five each other by torchlight.) It is as the film winds past the halfway mark that the cobweb appears to stretch past breaking point. There are too many false-scares, terrifying jolts that quickly turn tiresome considering they come from dreams, injected in an injudicious attempt to say boo. This is the sort of creep-fest which is better creating an uneasy buildup than at actually scaring the pants off you, and perhaps it should have stayed goosepimply instead of going for the jugular. Ek Thi Daayan isn't a truly scary film -- though it will provoke nightmares in the young, and I strongly recommend all parents keep their children away from this one. As if losing confidence in the narrative, the film tries to do too much in the second half -- with suddenly oscillating variations in tone and mood -- but thanks to performances and craft, it chugs along well enough. An ominous character called Lisa is introduced quite inventively into the story, and the film appears to hit the next level when that wonderful Yaaram song takes on a different meaning. Alas, it is here that things start to go aground. Clues point so determinedly in one particular direction that they convince us the film must take the other route, merely for twist*s sake, and the climax unforgivably descends into B-movie territory. Suddenly there is too much malarkey and, worse yet, too much talking about malarkey. A lot of which makes absolutely no sense. A film that started off smartly restrained sadly ends up cacophonic and, frankly, more than a little silly. By the time the actual end comes around, it*s hard to care. Ek Thi Daayan, therefore, isn't the scariest of horror films. It is, though, smartly crafted, highly original in its approach and a strikingly ambitious effort for the genre. The end is a let-down, but the film remains a fine directorial debut for Iyer. As Bobo tells Misha while giving her a glimpse into subterranean hell, *don't be scared, look.* *Daro nahin, dekho.*</Review>

A genre film more often than not plays out along familiar lines, letting the audience always stay a step ahead of the action. Ek Thi Daayan, at least its first half, doesn't. Not only does it defy most preconceived notions that you might have until the lights go out and the supernatural drama begins to unfold, it also leaves you so befuddled by the end of it all that you don't really know what to make of the film. Pretty much like its male protagonist, Bobo the Baffler, the film plays tricks that are at times beyond easy comprehension but you still go along with the flow. What really is Ek This Daayan: an out-and-out horror film, a creepy paranormal thriller or a twisted psychological drama? It actually blends elements from all three genres and weaves around them the anguished love story of a man whose obsession with the occult gets the better of him. By the time the film winds down, it also throws in a moralistic good demon-bad demon twist. The names of the principal characters * Bobo, Diana, Tamara, Lisa * are all drawn from the Gothic space, while the central yarn about evil witches and malefic spirits has been yanked out of hoary indigenous grandma*s tales. Ek Thi Daayan is saved from outright damnation by its multi-layered storyline and the unusual manner in which debutant director Kannan Iyer orchestrates the narrative. Both have a touch of novelty. But that*s about it. Take the surface gloss away from Ek Thi Daayan and all you have is a rather muddled film that meanders into a tame denouement that borders on the risible. The director overplays his hand and puts all his cards on the table a tad too quickly. Once the element of shock and surprise are out of the equation in the first half, the film falls into a predictable pattern. The taut first half plays out in dimly lit spaces * an old apartment building, corridors wrapped in darkness, and a spooky elevator that leads to a nether world. Fear and foreboding hang heavy over this portion of the film and the jolts are delivered to great effect. The second half is different in terms of both pacing and texture. The lighting brightens up, a wedding takes place, and a love ditty is sung at a party, but, in the bargain, the film loses some of its grip. A star magician, who is at the peak of his prowess, is shaken by frightening hallucinations and begins to make embarrassing mistakes on the stage. Turns out he was hounded by a witch when he was an 11-year-old. Many years later, the ghost of the past has returned to haunt the illusionist. His girlfriend tries to help him out, but he needs psychiatric help. Enter a family shrink who resorts to hypnosis to draw the magician out of his shell. But the question is: are his fears merely imagined or are they for real, triggered off by the presence of the women around him * a stepmother, a lover and a mysterious fan who flies in from Canada to sow more doubts in his mind? By the time the answer is worked out by the screenplay and the strange occurrences begin to make some sense, Ek This Daayan runs out of steam. It settles for a rather predictable climax that is at variance with the attempts Iyer makes up to this point to invest the narrative with stray jabs at logic. The performances are first-rate. Emraan Hashmi, an actor who is often not given his due, gives the character of the haunted magician just that * a haunted feel that is just apt. Each of the three actresses in the cast * Konkona Sen Sharma, Kalki Koechlin and Huma Qureshi * is as good as the other, bringing a distinct, palpable psychological shade to the table with natural ease. The Ek This Daayan soundtrack is embellished with Gulzar*s lyrics and Vishal Bhardwaj*s musical compositions. So at least on one front the film belongs to absolutely the top drawer. Phurrr kar ke tote udd gaye isn't an average wedding number, nor is Yaaram just another romantic song. The rest of the film, barring a few moments that spring out of nowhere to deliver a shock or two, struggles to measure up. Ek This Daayan is passable fare as a scary movie * the dark, spooky mood is sustained with the aid of dark, shadowy interiors and an effective and unobtrusive background score. It might have helped had the film not been given to quite as much thematic obfuscation. Is it intriguing enough to sustain audience interest over two hours and a bit? Most certainly. Is it a true spine-chiller? Only occasionally. The riveting parts of Ek This Daayan are far outnumbered by the limp moments. Yet it is worth a watch owing to the idiosyncratic treatment of a done-to-death genre.</Review>

So does Ek Thi Daayan cast the spell? Let's find out. Bobo (Emraan Hashmi), India's most popular magician has an easy life of tricks and spells. He has a steady girlfriend Tamara (Huma Qureshi) and an orphan child he loves and wants to adopt. However, unknown to all, he nurses a dark past that starts haunting him all over again. We are then taken to an 11 year old Bobo, all inquisitive in occult and witchcraft, who finds himself in a pit of the dark world. When he comes back, he starts getting haunted by a Daayan in the garb of Konkona Sen Sharma. How his past, that wrecked havoc in his life then starts haunting him all over again is what follows through the rest of the plot. Both Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj hand the reigns of the film in the hands of a debutant filmmaker Kannan Iyer. And despite his novice hands and such huge responsibility, Kannan holds fort strongly and delves deep into the Indian mythical concept of daayan. He explores the ancient folk lore of daayan eating up the kids and implements it intelligently in the format of a horror-suspense but mid way into the film it starts appearing that he loses focus altogether as his film goes completely haywire. The first half of Ek This Daayan is an absolute delight. Although it uses the common ingredients of a spook-fest, the sudden thuds, the increasing sound effects etc. but the built up of the film is so seamless and flawless that you can't help but be at the edge of your seats. But just when you eagerly settle post interval and expect the chills to increase, it all starts fizzling out with the song and dance insertions, Kalki Koechlin's entry and a climax so hackneyed that you literally get disappointed and annoyed. For what seems like an attempt at leaving a thread for a sequel, Kannan totally turns his story into hogwash. Also there are far too many things left unexplained and unanswered yet showcased purely taking the cinematic liberty to move the story forward. Even on technical front there are continuity errors which are visible even to a commoner. There's one person for whom the film becomes a definite watch is Konkona Sen Sharma. Her act of a sly daayan who pretends to be extremely loving at the outset and then shows her real intent what with all the scary look and act is extremely frightening and executed brilliantly on her part. Another actor who outshines many biggies is the child actor Vishesh Tiwar who plays the younger Bobo. The way he handles the film completely on his young shoulders is commendable. Emraan Hashmi too is at his top form and gives a convincing performance. The same can't be said, however, about Kalki Koechlin and Huma Qureshi. While Kalki's character gets completely wasted in the film, Huma just gives a passable performance with nothing to rave about. If you divide the ratings in the first and the second half, Ek Thi Daayan deserves full marks for its unblemished and watertight first half. The second however is a total waste.</Review>

It's piping hot (it's got Emraan Hashmi--who calls himself a tiger in bed), terribly scary and yet it's aesthetically garnished. Set in contemporary Mumbai; the film tells you a believable story of Bobo(Emraan) the magician, who is a master in his craft. But when you scratch the surface, scars from his growing up years come to light. Cut to Bobo's childhood. He's a curly-haired, cute moppet(Vishesh; he plays the young Emraan) who grows up reading about witch-craft and is inexplicably drawn to magic. He doesn't realise that his fascination is fast becoming an obsession. Things reach a head, when his widower father (Pawan Malhotra) brings home a new bride Diana ( Konkana Sen Sharma). The boy equates a step-mother to a daayan(witch) and his young mind plays tricks with him. You find yourself biting your nails in nervousness and digging your heels hard into the carpet in the cinema hall as this spook-fest unfolds. Woven beautifully between the world of magic, occult and suspense, Ek Thi Daayan, makes for compulsive viewing, providing some spine-chilling thrills at short gaps. The narrative in the first half is almost faultless. There are some nice romantic moments between the lead pair Emraan and Huma and a couple of songs too. But just when you start to relax and flow with the emotions, along comes a scary twist that jolts you back to the edge of your seat. The climax is a bit stereotype of horror/supernatural thrillers but that's a minor hiccup in an otherwise cleverly done film of this genre. Vishal Bharadwal's music and Gulzar's lyrics*especially kaali kaali, yaaram and lautungi main are outstanding. Of the performers*Konkana Sen Sharma and Emraan Hashmi are in top form. Huma Qureshi, Kalki Koechlin, Pawan Malhotra and the child actor, Vishesh are very competent. Kannan Iyer makes an impressive debut...and kudos to Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bharadwaj for allowing him to bring his daayan to life without compromises. This film doesn't play to the galleries nor is it one of those brain-dead movies that Bollywood churns out as assembly line.</Review>

A genre that's intimidating as well as thrilling. Do ghosts/spirits exist? What about black magic? Is it a myth? Does it really work? Last year, films like RAAZ 3 [a fading actress indulges in black magic to settle scores with an upcoming actress], TALAASH [the spirit of a dead woman kills the perpetrators of the crime] and more recently, AATMA [the fight between a woman and her dead husband over their child] took the spectator into the world of aatmas and spirits. EK THI DAAYAN may come across as yet another fare that talks of ghosts/witches, occult and the likes, but it is, perhaps, the first Hindi movie that presents witchcraft most realistically. Also, it's one of the most eerie experiences to unfold on the Bollywood screen. Our country is pierced with superstitions, fallacies and erroneous beliefs. We have heard tales of witches. Myths such as daayans can be good looking, their feet are turned inwards, their power lies in the plait [choti], so on and so forth end up making the spectator believe in stories surrounding evil, paranormal, supernatural and mystical powers. EK THI DAAYAN makes you react to the rituals/practices that have existed since time immemorial, but, I'd like to elucidate, it does not glorify the practice. Intense and scary, EK THI DAAYAN is positioned in today's times and the folklore of a witch, integrated smartly in the screenplay, makes it a fascinating cinematic experience. Bobo [Emraan Hashmi] is India's leading magician. But unknown to even his girlfriend Tamara [Huma Qureshi], Bobo's life is falling apart. His constant hallucinations leave him with no option but to seek psychiatric help. Going through hypnosis, a terrifying story about his childhood surfaces involving a sinister power called 'Daayan', who has not only destroyed his family, but also promised to return to haunt Bobo. Bobo chooses to ignore it and move on with his life. Just when his career and love life is at full throttle, enters the irresistible Lisa Dutt [Kalki Koechlin]. Bobo is convinced that she is the daayan. But is she, really? Or is he just losing his mind? There is something out there that is inexplicable, that is beyond the realm of human comprehension that EK THI DAAYAN taps grippingly. First-time director Kannan Iyer steps forward to offer something radically different in this genre and for those who believe in daayans -- even those who don't -- will take to the plot instantly because Kannan's storytelling is lucid and graspable. The flashback portions in the first hour are noteworthy, with Emraan revisiting his childhood. At the same time, Kannan ensures that there's a love story running parallel to the main story, besides integrating the mandatory songs in the narrative, thus steering clear of being labeled 'dark and dry' in the process. Thankfully, EK THI DAAYAN is not the standard horror fare and the storyteller does a volte face in the concluding reels. The suspense -- when it unravels -- is sure to hit you like a ton of bricks. However, the film tends to get a bit predictable at this point and the pacing too slows down soon after the interval, but the scare quotient and the twist towards the final stages more than compensate for the shortcomings. Living up to the reputation of coming up with a qualitative musical score, Vishal Bhardwaj delivers a soundtrack that's seeped in melody. 'Yaaram' is the most endearing track [and hugely popular too], while 'Kaali Kaali' and 'Totey Ud Gaye' are catchy compositions as well. In keeping with the mood of the film, the DoP [Saurabh Goswami] keeps the frames dark, but he ought to know that the [dark] tone can prove to be an eyesore at times. The visual effects [Prana Studios] are top notch. Background score [Clinton Cerejo] deserves special mention. It adds to the spooky ambience. Emraan Hashmi nails his character. He carries the film on his broad shoulders, bringing plenty of soul to his character. This is amongst his finest works, undoubtedly! EK THI DAAYAN marks Konkona Sen Sharma's tryst with the horror genre and given her acting experience, she delivers a terrific performance yet again. After portraying the part of a small-town girl in her first two films, Huma Qureshi exudes coolness and confidence in this new avatar. Kalki Koechlin looks perfect for her part, but her character tends to get a bit confusing towards the final moments. Pavan Malhotra is first-rate yet again. Rajatava Dutta [as Emraan's doctor] is remarkable. Bhavesh Balchandani, the child artist, is alright, but it is another child artist, Vishesh Tiwari [portraying the young Emraan], who delivers a super performance. The child artist portraying Vishesh's sister is simply adorable. On the whole, EK THI DAAYAN is an imaginative and appealing supernatural thriller. The film is placed in a relatable world, with myths about witches expertly intertwined in its absorbing screenplay, something which a spectator can effortlessly identify with. Exceptionally novel and attention-grabbing, it's a first of its kind. Watch it for the sheer novelty it puts on display in its genre!</Review>

Sadly, much is lost in translation. related stories Director Rohan Sippy is unable to fully retain the lightness and effervescence of the original. Nautanki Saala! is funny in parts but often feels stretched and flat, like champagne without the fizz. The film is about the tumultuous relationship between a theatre actor-director, Ram (played by Ayushmann Khurrana), and a suicidal depressive, Mandar (played by Kunaal Roy Kapur). They first meet when Mandar is attempting to kill himself. Ram saves him. What ensues is a convoluted comedy of errors that has Ram falling in love with Mandar*s ex-girlfriend and Mandar playing the lead in Ram*s play, which, incidentally, is called Raavan Leela. The best thing here is Kunaal Roy Kapur. He retains an expression of tragic confusion throughout and steals every scene he*s in. Watch out for his killer audition for the role of Ram. Ayushmann is earnest but can't match Kunaal*s comic chops. Still, the scenes between the two have wit and verve * which is sorely lacking in the romantic tracks. The heroines are bewilderingly bland. I also couldn't figure out why, in the last reel, the film shifts gears to melodrama. It feels out of synch. Nautanki Saala! has all the ingredients of a peppy, amiable comedy but this souffl?oesn't quite rise. If you must, check it out for Kunaal*s performance, the fun music and the superbly garish glimpses of Raavan Leela * a play that I would definitely want to watch.</Review>

Ayushmann Khurrana plays Ram Parmar, or RP, a kind-natured theatre actor who, while rushing home after work one night, notices a random stranger trying to kill himself. RP stops the fellow - a homeless, heartbroken chap named Mandar Lele (Kunal Roy Kapur) - then proceeds to straighten out the poor sap's life, first by allowing him to crash at the home RP shares with his girlfriend, then by reuniting him with his ex, ditzy florist Nandini (Pooja Salvi). But as often tends to happen in such films, RP ends up falling for Nandini too. Based on the 2003 French film 'Apres Vous', set in a Parisian restaurant, 'Nautanki Saala' stages its comedy against the backdrop of a long-running play. Although intended as a farce, the film is never as outrageous as it needs to be, settling instead for the kind of inoffensive silliness that's often plain boring. RP's attempts to break up Nandini and her new lover come off as infantile, and his unwavering commitment to help Mandar is puzzling after a point. The film works best in its most zany moments, like the portion where RP mimes words and phrases discreetly to help Mandar get through an acting audition. Or an earlier scene where RP must read Mandar's suicide note to his cataract-afflicted grandmother, changing the words as he goes to make it more upbeat. There are some nice supporting characters too, who pop up occasionally to deliver a few laughs. Like the effete producer of RP's play, who is at his wit's end with Mandar during his audition, yet agrees to cast him when RP offers a sweet trade-off. Even the Malayali hospital receptionist who needs an interpreter to unscramble her rushed instructions. But alas such genuinely inventive bits are few and far between in this muddled film that becomes a sentimental love triangle midway. What sucks the soul out of 'Nautanki Saala' is the unfathomable casting of the vapid female lead. Newcomer Pooja Salvi is about as expressive as a sack of grains. She contributes little here, beyond batting her eyelids while seesawing from one man to another. Ayushmann Khurrana carries forward his confidence from Vicky Donor, yet he's exasperatingly over-animated and too slick for a character that needed to ooze a na? sincerity. It's Kunal Roy Kapoor as the slobbering, sloppy man-child Mandar, who wins your heart with his nicely understated performance. Like previous films directed by Sippy, 'Nautanki Saala' has a winning soundtrack, and unfolds across real locations in South Mumbai, a part of the city rarely seen in our movies. Still, they contribute little to the film's slight, over-stretched premise, and the portions at the theatre are needlessly long and not particularly funny. I'm going with two out of five for 'Nautanki Saala'. Sippy never brings the lightness of touch needed to pull off this kind of film. Like the title suggests, it's all empty theatrics. And wait, the film also has the unique distinction of capturing one of the longest on-screen smooches in a long time.. shot in such excruciating close-up that you might throw up your lunch.</Review>

There*s one who can engross over the plainest of stories by embellishing it with colourful expression and vivid details. The other, however, can turn the most spellbinding yarn into a cumbersome exercise with his needless digressions, numerous pauses and speech interruptions. In his fourth film as director, Rohan Sippy finds himself swiveling in the midst of these two extremes. Without doubt the man is bright when it comes to the visual design of his films and injecting funk in its eclectic sound. Also, few can shoot Mumbai as memorably as he does. He renders the same stylised treatment on his latest, Nautanki Saala, an official remake of Pierre Salvadori*s Apr?vous. (It may be recalled Katrina Kaif was in a bid to buy the rights of Salvadori*s Audrey Tautou-starrer Priceless, eventually procured by UTV.) I have not seen the French original but I believe Sippy rewrote quite a bit to fit it in the Indian milieu changing the backdrop from a restaurant to a theatre. The latter gives him a platform for inventive imagery and being the technical wizard he is, does just that -- from resplendent lighting and elaborate props to artistically choreographed sequences, depicting a grand battle of shadows against the blood red curtains. The film begins inside a shrink*s office with theatre actor/director Ram Parmar (Ayushmann Khurana) revealing the reason behind his sudden loss of appetite, insomnia, heavy drinking, three simultaneous break-ups and, maybe, why he is tugging so tightly to a teddy bear that resembles Ted (in mute mode)?  In this apathetic city, where everyone begins honking crazily and gets abusive if a car takes just two extra seconds to start after the signal turns green, Ram not only notices a man (Kunaal Roy Kapur as Mandar) trying to take his life but also takes him in, provides him with food, clothing, shelter, hospital bills, applying Betadine on his butt, drives him to Pune, meets his grandmother (Sulbha Arya), refuses to be repulsed by his mucous dripping nose and then promptly offers the guy a parallel lead role of Lord Ram in his play, Ravanleela while working over-time to fix the hopeless chap*s messy love life, also the reason behind his initial suicide attempt. It*s all very far-fetched obviously since Ram isn't lonely or desperate for company. He doesn't exactly seem like a philanthropist either. The man appears consumed by theatre and his live-in girlfriend (a charming Gaelyn Mendonca); he*s clearly very successful, affluent -- lives in a tasteful pad in SoBo with pockets overflowing with 500 rupee notes. Sippy does this nimbly. He keeps the incredulity so understated allowing Khurana to play the good guy card without fuss while Kunaal doles out a gloomy Eeyore to the T. And, you buy the quirky premise. It*s also worth noting (and appreciating) how Nautanki refrains from any homophobic humour whatsoever. At this point Nautanki Saala is brimming with promise and pleasantness, the screen is saturated with rich shades of orange and blue (cinematography by Manoj Lobo), the air is filled with Nitin Mukesh and Shabbir Kumar*s velvety rendition of So gaya yeh jahaan and Saba Azad*s throaty seduction in Evelyn Sharma*s body (Dil ki toh lag gayi) and the wit bears crunch -- Jo aur kuch nahi kar sakta woh actor hi banega. Aur jise acting bhi nahi aati? Woh director. Accents are often used as a means to amuse. Sippy uses the ploy but without any intent to ridicule or distort cultural stereotypes.  And so you chuckle without remorse when Ram*s producer Chandra (Sanjeev Bhatt) brings up Naseerundin Shah, Parvesh Rawal and Abhishesh Bachchan or a robotic receptionist (Sheela Das) rattles off standard protocol like one of those Udipi joint waiters in fast forward. For all its frothy build-up, which peaks during Mandar*s disastrous audition turned hilarious game of dumb charades scene and Ram*s bumbling attempt to pass him off as an actor of note (a la The Emperor*s New Clothes), Nautanki Saala never really takes off as a full-bodied story. The basic problem here, despite the potential, is the script progresses too slowly. Especially after Pooja Salvi*s Nandini comes in the picture; it*s not just Ram and Mandar who lose focus. True, there are moments of genuine laughter but this fleeting gratification demands extensive wait and endurance.  Sippy punctuates his scenes with too many pauses resulting in a dawdling pace and delayed conflicts, which makes its 130 minutes running time lengthier than it should. It doesn't help that Salvi has a wobbly screen presence and cannot elevate her one-dimensional character to likeable forget impressive. Her scenes with Khurrana feel terribly awkward and lethargic even if they kiss for about one reel of Nautanki Saala. And also because her presence invariably brings her cringe-worthy ex-boyfriend Loli (Rufy Khan) -- short for Lokesh Limaye in the picture. Khurrana, himself, is in terrific form. After Vicky Donor, I was worried he may get slotted in the smooth-talking lout roles but his pliability and relaxed poise as Ram reflects his range. Kapur, of course, gets maximum applause with his restrained, unaffected performance as the weepy, moody, pessimistic and low on self-confidence/esteem Mandar. He gets the tone of Mandar so right, so real without even once trying to go the freak route.    Rohan Sippy*s creation shows so much promise and has several moments (even if most of them are featured in its trailer). But the plot seems better-suited for a sitcom episode. As a film the nautanki stretches for too long, saala.</Review>

As the lips of a guy and girl meet, we are guided through a spectrum: initial reluctance sliding into a hmm-not-too-bad exploration steadying into a breathless lock-in. This is one of Nautanki Saala's highlights. Watching it you realise how new this coming together of consenting adults through the simple expedient of a kiss, well done, still feels in new age Bollywood. And that is the best part about this absurdist lad com by Rohan Sippy, that he is trying something different, and within that, some of it feels fresh and fizzy. Hurrying home one night, theatre man RP aka Ram Parmar (Ayushmann Khurrana) saves a fellow from killing himself. Turns out that Mandar Lele (Kunaal Roy Kapur) really is the sort of a chap you feel death would have improved. He is a true loser, having lost his girl Nandini (Pooja Salvi), and all desire to live. Of course he has nowhere to go, and nothing to do. So of course 'nautanki' RP gets to cart Mandar around, despite earning the annoyance of girlfriend (Gaelyn Mendonca), and his theatre mates by insisting on getting him (Mandar) a part in the play: how else to keep suicide at bay ? The 'naatak' RP and co are performing is a version of the 'Ramayan', and the antics on stage remind you of another film in another era which used another epic to create unforgettable laughter. But Nautanki Saala is not aiming for big picture black-edged absurd like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. Its theatre is more personal, more intimate. It's about two young men and their bumbling attempts at finding love, and its plot is based on a French comedy (Nautanki Saala is the official remake of Apres Vous), rejigged a bit for Bollywood. But this film is weighed down by its pace and the length. It starts slow and stays slow for much too long. Also, the tonal switches from the absurd to the real make it inconsistent. What is this film's address? The performers are also not all at par. In his second film, Ayushmann Khurrana is the one who does the heavy-lifting, making us believe that Vicky Donor was not a fluke ; Kunaal Roy Kapur, who was such a hoot in Delly Belly, is singularly single tone, with just a couple of moments when you feel the click, of him and his part coming together. Salvi, as the fresh-faced girl of their dreams, starts unremarkably, and lifts a bit only towards the end. Sippy has a feel for staging scenes, and some are laugh-out-loud. The idea that true love can be found through such a random route is also nice, and lends the film a pleasing slightness. But the nautanki in this film is an on-off thing. I wish there was much more of it. Two and a half stars.</Review>
      <Review Id="122" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/movie-review-nautanki-saala-801" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="11 April, 2013" Likes="27" Rating="3/5">At a time when it might seem that mainstream Bollywood is stuck in the rut of cannibalising Hindi hits of the past, here is a Mumbai film that is nothing if not different. It is inspired by a French romantic comedy of a decade ago. Rohan Sippy*s Nautanki Saala!, with its robust desi twist to a very Gallic idea, has the feel of an oasis in the desert. It ultimately turns out to be just a mirage, but all said and done its idiosyncrasies have the heft to lift the film high enough and keep it afloat all the way through to the end. Sippy transports Pierre Salvadori*s Apres Vous from its Parisian restaurant setting to the madcap milieu of a Mumbai playhouse and spices it up with vigorous nods to Bollywood movies and music. He nearly pulls off the unlikely transmogrification. And that in itself is no mean achievement. Thanks to spot-on star turns by the two male leads, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kunaal Roy Kapur, and a stable flow of amusing, if not outright hilarious, comic punches, Nautanki Saala! is, in the main, a watchable film. It might have been even better had the three female characters in this crazy love story been allowed a little more space to evolve into emotionally tangible beings. They are no more than mere props in the backdrop. One girl who is about to walk out on her steady boyfriend tells another who is caught in the midst of several suitors: this is 2013 and you are in control. Truth be told, she is anything but. There are three guys in this second girl*s life * one is her past, one her present, the yet another one her probable future. It is they who hold the strings. She yo-yos from one to other like a helpless marionette. Not on! But let us not nitpick about the extent to which Nautanki Saala! is found wanting. It really does not matter. The quirky love triangle that forms the crux of the film is intriguing enough to last the course. The male protagonist, Ram Parmar, RP to his friends, is a stage actor and director who plays Raavan in a long-running stage production. In trying to live up to his mythic name, he weaves a web of lies and half-truths and indulges in much playacting so that he can bring a suicidal man (Kunaal Roy Kapur) back from the brink. Late for a dinner date, RP, who thrives on doing a good turn a day, chances upon this guy who is about to hang himself from a tree. He thwarts the suicide attempt and takes the bundle of nerves under his wings. The latter * his name, as RP learns only after he visits his grandmother in Pune, is Mandar Lele * is a high school dropout and jilted lover who wallows endlessly in self-loathing. The source of Mandar*s woes is the girl he loves, Nandini Patel (Pooja Salvi), a florist. She has ditched the guy because he is a nobody. RP figures out that the only way he can mend the sad soul*s broken heart is by getting the girl back into his life. The line between life and drama begins to blur as Ram falls for the wrong girl, his own partner leaves him, and a pervasive sense of guilt gets a firm grip on him. RP*s girlfriend, Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca), describes Mandar as a *zakhmi narcissist*. But it is difficult to figure out what the bumbling man really is as he hurtles through a series of events until he is turned by a quirk of fate into Lord Rama in RP*s long-running play Raavan Leela. The consistently snappy writing (the screenplay and dialogue are credited to Sippy, Nipun Dharamadhikari and Charudutt Acharya) lends the film the rhythm of a stand-up act. Nautanki Saala! is character and dialogue-driven rather than action-oriented. The humour flows from the core of the situations and the verbal exchanges. It does not have to fall back on meaningless gags for effect. Even when the pace tends to be sluggish, which is quite often, and the drama appears to flag a bit, the film is never less than interesting in its own genteel way. Ayushmann Khurrana is an absolute natural. He does not miss a single trick as he sails through the role of the nice guy who takes acting too seriously for his own good. Kunaal Roy Kapur is just as good although the character he plays is somewhat inconsistent in the way it is etched out. He sinks his teeth deep into the flesh of the exasperatingly diffident guy who never stops moaning and groaning. His deadpan demeanour fits in perfectly * it raises a few chuckles while evoking some bemused sympathy. Technically, too, Nautanki Saala! is a fine film. Especially noteworthy is DoP Manoj Lobo*s contribution to its look and texture. The musical score, a whimsical but delightful blend of retro Bollywood sounds and original tracks, adds a distinctive layer to the film*s aural design. The film deserves full marks for intention, if not for execution. But give me Nautanki Saala! any day after the merciless assault of Himmatwala and Chashme Baddoor!.</Review>

Rohan Sippy is among those rare ones who don't indulge dimwitted situations in a bid to make for humour. His latest release Nautanki Saala appears to be a quirky riot; at least from what the promos suggest. Does it do the trick? Let's find out. Ram Parmar aka 'RP' (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a theatre artist who portrays the evil mythological character Raavan on stage plays. But ironically, the person is nothing like that in real life. Instead he is a do-gooder almost to the point of being bumbler. His antics are hilarious for he saves this absolute stranger from committing suicide and brings him home, telling his live-in girlfriend that the person is his buddy. The hopeless nincompoop for a stranger, Mandar Lele (Kunaal Roy Kapoor), is the sort who has nothing to look forward to. In a bid to find happiness in his lonely and suicidal friend's life, RP loses himself and finds himself broken by the end of it. In the times of heedless remakes where there's sheer starworship and zilch attention to the script, Rohan Sippy chooses to remake Pierre Salvadori's Apres Vous, a french roaring hit, and gives its setting a complete 360 degree switch. The filmmaker moves away from the endless rut of mindless comic capers and presents a highly situational comedy that is quirky, witty and everything that the film industry is deprived off. Although the maker doesn't quite manage to pull off the entire romantic track from the remake of the rom-com the dates back almost a decade ago, all courtesy its hackeneyed approach, Nautanki Saala still remains quite a feet in the comedy genre all because of its innovatively different approach. The initial 30 minutes are an absolute laugh riot with the twisted depiction of Ramayan with Sita flocking away with Hanuman on a scooter, Lakshman disappearing from the act and Ram taking over the avatar of Raavan! However, soon after the romantic angle sets in the movie gets into a downward spiral. The respite in the spiral screenplay comes with both actors Ayushmann Khurrana and Kunaal Roy Kapoor who flawlessly essay their parts to perfection. Ayushmann clearly depicts that he isn't a one film wonder and is definitely here to stay for long. Kunaal showcases his theatrical antics brilliantly and should definitely do more films. All the three girls Evelyn Sharma as Sita, Pooja Salvi as Nandini, Gaelyn Mendonca as Chitra are average at best. The maker could definitely do better in the female leads department. Music my multiple artists is quite an assortment and Rohan Sippy uses the tracks impressively as the backgrounds. To sum it up, Nautanki Saala may not be a flawless film but it definitely deserves a watch for its refreshing comedy and delightful performances by the two main lead actors.</Review>

Sita zips off on a scooty with 'beary' 'good friend' Hanuman. Laksman is out of sight. And a brand new Ramleela plays out; where even the mighty Raavan (with all ten heads) can't crack his part. Gods must be crazy, alright, in this kalyug ki Ramayan. More comedy, less chastity. More drama, less dagabaaz. The stage is set and it's showtime folks. All starting one night when theater actor/director Ram Parmar (Ayushmann) saves a lonely soul, Mandar Lele (Kunaal) from committing suicide. In a godly act, Ram takes on the sole responsibility (no divine intervention, please) of giving loser Lele a new lease of life. Ram trains him to enact (Lord) Ram in his play Raavan-Leela, while he also dramatizes a series of acts to reunite Lele with his estranged lovergal, Nandini (Pooja). Romeo-Juliet RIP! There's more drama coming up. All hell (or is it heaven) break loose in Ram's life when he crosses the lakshman rekha. The acts get mixed up, roles reversed; ironically his self-created Ram katha goes kaput, leading to a comedy of errors of 'epic' proportions. Call it Act of God if you wish! (Hey, Ram!) It's time for curtain calls. Thou art Ayushmann, take a bow. This natural nautanki hits target once again. He role-plays with perfect comic timing and superb confidence. Ayushmann bhava! Kunaal is also effortlessly excellent, adding drama and hilarity. What's best is the boys pitch the dramedy without much melodrama. Applause! Pooja looks too unrehearsed to get her act right and Gaelyn (as Ram's girlfriend) manages to breeze through. Rohan Sippy plays his part well too. The story is refreshing; the theater-like treatment (sets, props, costumes) is dramatically different. The background score blends smoothly and the quirky humour comes alive in the irony of situations and performances (unlike the monotony of hammy slapstick). The second half slows down with predictable acts, and Ram's godliness is too unreal, yet making you guffaw like Raavan on steroids. This is no Shakespearean act, but there's enough drama, demons and devtaas to rival our desi phantoms of the operas.</Review>

Recall films like DELHI BELLY, KAHAANI, PAAN SINGH TOMAR and VICKY DONOR. Also, one of the strengths of the recent success story, JOLLY LLB, was its absorbing storyline, which was so well presented on celluloid by its creator, Subhash Kapoor. It's alright to be greedy when it comes to high-quality content, right? Rohan Sippy, who has worked with formidable names in his earlier endeavors, casts several relative newcomers in his new outing, NAUTANKI SAALA!. The focus, like the films listed above, is on telling a story that's fascinating and enthralling. I am told, NAUTANKI SAALA! is Rohan's lowest budget film so far. But this thought hardly crosses your mind as you embark on this voyage. For, this one's armed with a fascinating premise that's nourished with care by the raconteur, magnificent act by its lead actors, dollops of humor [wicked, sparkling, smart] that's punctuated so well in the scheme of things and eye-filling production design. NAUTANKI SAALA! is, without doubt, Rohan's most accomplished work so far! While returning from work one night, Ram Parmar [Ayushmann Khurrana] rescues the luckless Mandar Lele [Kunaal Roy Kapur] from his suicide attempt and inexplicably takes on the responsibility of rehabilitating him. Mandar has failed at every job... worse, he's also lost the love of his life, Nandini [Pooja Salvi]. Ram decides to reunite Mandar with his sweetheart, but, in turn, falls in love with her... An official remake of the French film APRES VOUS [2003], NAUTANKI SAALA! is *not* another slapstick comedy that uses every trick in the book to make you laugh. On the contrary, the humor here is tailored for spectators who love new-age cinema. At the same time, comedy is serious business and very few film-makers have the knack of making people chuckle/giggle at the right places/episodes and Rohan gets it absolutely right all through the first hour. To give the credit where it's due, Rohan steps into a new terrain with NAUTANKI SAALA!, but the plot as well as the situations are so unfussy and uncomplicated and the characters so convincing [and timid too!] that you start taking to the goings-on without much struggle. The promotional material may give an impression that NAUTANKI SAALA! is yet another bromance saga, but there's a love story -- a love triangle, in fact -- that's ingeniously integrated in the premise. While the first hour is thoroughly amusing [a few episodes are howlarious actually!], the post-interval do a somersault. Rohan and his team of writers [screenplay: Nipun Dharmadhikari, Charudutt Acharya and Rohan himself] introduce certain complications in the lead characters' lives, which take the familiar route and dilute the impact, albeit faintly. Also, a few episodes don't work, the pacing gets slow, the narrative is prolonged* till it gathers steam towards its resolution. The film never gets into the serious zone or melodramatic, but remains lightweight all through, which is a plus. In short, Rohan has cleverly adapted and modified the French film to suit the Indian sensibilities, which works exceedingly well for the Indian spectator. With a music company backing the film [T-Series], the soundtrack ought to be lively, with the songs holding tremendous recall value. The tracks are smart, trendy and seeped in melody. 'Mera Mann' is the pick of the lot, while 'Saddi Gali' is equally soothing. The yesteryear hit, 'Dhak Dhak', too finds a place in the narrative in a new avatar [towards the end credits]. The DoP [Manoj Lobo] captures the theatre backdrop, indoor look as well as locales of South Mumbai with zing. I'd like to make a special mention of the one-liners, which are soaked in wittiness and most importantly, devoid of double entendres. The production design is eye-catching, especially the setting in the theatre. The camaraderie between Ayushmann and Kunaal is magnificent and the best part is, the roles are clearly divided. Situations such as trying to outdo the other, therefore, just don't arise. Ayushmann gets yet another demanding role and the actor, who impressed us with his acting skills in VICKY DONOR, casts a spell yet again. Kunaal is tremendous too. The actor, who scored brownie points in DELHI BELLY, is incredible as the goofy, hapless, good-for-nothing guy. Of the leading ladies, Gaelyn Mendonca [as Chitra] is sprightly and most confident. Pooja Salvi could do better if she spruces up her acting skills, though she flaunts the vulnerable look well. Evelyn Sharma's presence is restricted to a few sequences only. Rufy Khan is serviceable. Sanjeev Bhatt [as Chandra, the theatre producer] is a riot. He brings the house down every time he appears on screen, especially during the sequence when Kunaal is being auditioned. Sulbha Arya [as Kunaal's grand-mom] is super. Abhishek Bachchan appears in a cameo. On the whole, NAUTANKI SAALA! is uncontaminated, witty and amusing, offers an interesting premise with plenty of good laughs. A lightweight fare that caters to cineastes with an appetite for contemporary cinema, this movie ought to be on your 'to watch' list for sure!</Review>

The two men meet on a Mumbai street just as the heartbroken and teary Mandar is about to hang himself from a noose tied to a tree. Ram, the actor and director of Raavanleela, an ongoing popular play, is in a relationship with a shrieky go-getter, Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca), almost under duress, and he decides to take charge of Mandar*s life*to change him and make him understand his worth. The set-up has enough absurdity and comedic potential. Beginning with a trip to the home of Mandar*s grandmother, Nautanki Saala!, adapted from the French film Apr?Vous, begins as a farce. There are some hilarious situations, and although largely overacted both by Khurrana and Roy Kapoor, the comic timing of some of the initial scenes is bang on. Ram*s attempt to enrol Mandar in his drama company in the role of Ram, while he plays Raavan, produces some knee-slapping moments. photo A still from *Nautanki Saala!* The film loses steam as Ram tries to redeem Mandar*s love life with Nandini (Pooja Salvi), a florist and an unmitigated bimbo. The jokes fizzle, and towards the overwrought, yawn-inducing, clich?idden climax, the premise of the story itself seems to topple. Khurrana and Roy Kapoor are capable and entertaining for the most part. Roy Kapoor*s whiny Mandar is overall funnier perhaps than the know-it-all, chaos-gatherer Ram whom Khurrana lends an unjustified smugness to. Salvi and Mendonca deliver insipid performances. The memorable part is the art deco theatre (it was shot at Mumbai*s Liberty cinema) in which Raavanleela takes place. Cinematographer Manoj Lobo films it lustrously. Sippy efficiently uses the green room, theatre costumes, richly-lit stage and gloriously descending curtain to add atmospherics to his story. In production value and aesthetics, Nautanki Saala! is a hotchpotch. Some sequences smack of the mediocre and some are competent*it eventually plummets into a vapid romance.</Review>

Evidently you expect nothing but the best from this combo. In the end you aren't sure what has let you down more - your expectations or the film per se. The story is about a good soul Ram (Ayushmann Khurana) who saves a stranger, Mandar Lele (Kunal Roy Kapur) on the verge of suicide, post his breakup. Ram traces Mandar's ladylove, Nandini (Pooja Salvi) and tries to befriend her so that he can subsequently salvage Mandar's gloomy life. But eventually he falls for Nandini. Between emotions of love and guilt, he is left in a catch-22 situation. Officially derived from a French film Apres Vous (2003), the plot seems tailor-made for a Bollywood rom-com. Starting on a funny note, the humour in the initial portions arises from the Bheja Fry style cross-connected chemistry between the two divergently different male leads. However Ram's drive to go out of his way to help a complete stranger seems somewhat far-fetched. Nevertheless the film doesn't intend to expend time in bringing such conviction and even you overlook such inconsistency in hopes that something better would follow. The blithe first half breezes off in establishment of the protagonists and plot and in the anticipation of an enhanced second half. Unfortunately the graph of the narrative just dips post interval as the film boils down into being a typical love triangle, where the hero has to choose between his friend and his lover. One wonders what was so inspiring about Rohan Sippy's French muse, especially since the scenario of a man's sacrifice of love for his friend has been witnessed umpteenth times in India from Saajan to Kal Ho Na Ho. To its credit, the film is showered with dollops of tongue-in-cheek humour, a pleasant change from the slapstick or nonsensical gags that most recent comedies have to offer. The theatre backdrop makes for a unique setup and Mandar's audition for the role of Ram and his subsequent stage antics make way for some hilarious moments. Nautanki Saala also boasts of one of the most side-splitting scenes in recent memory where Ram has to strike a conversation with a complete stranger in a restaurant. Ayushmann's comic timing and the stranger's expressions in the scene are just priceless! However despite such achievements, the narrative takes the beaten path and dilutes in totality. The romance between Ram and Nandini is drab and seems stretched after a point. Also the friendship between Ram and Mandar is too superficial for you to feel for their subsequent estrangement. Amidst such tedium, the humour fails to register and suddenly you feel that the film is trying too hard to be funny. By the time the film reaches its verbose and dramatic climax, you already have got the end and lost hopes. Both Ayushmann Khurana (in his jovial attitude) and Kunal Roy Kapur (as the gross yet cute simpleton character), in a way, play an extension to what they did in their debut films respectively. Kunal underplays a little too much with his deadpan expressions while Ayushmann's energy doesn't help much either. Both, ham awfully in their drunken scenes. And with the tame script not doing justice to their caliber, you only feel bad for both! Pooja Salvi, who looks a mix between Hrishita Bhatt and Tanushree Dutta, is average. Gaelyn Mendonca seems more confident but has a shorter role. Evelyn Sharma doesn't get much scope but adds on as a good-looking prop on the stage. Nautanki Saala is a colloquial term often attributed to someone who is overtly dramatic yet amusing. While the film is thankfully not melodramatic, it isn't much amusing either!</Review>

Light-hearted humour and innocent romance makes way for sexist jokes and cheesy puns and the merits of keeping things simple are lost in the cacophony of screechy performances. But I have a confession to make here - I didn't hate the film. Dhawan is no Paranjpye, and his cinema is as subtle as a sledgehammer. The new 'Chashme Baddoor' does no justice to the 1981 gem, but it's not unwatchable either. What Dhawan's shrewdly done - under the guise of remaking a much-loved classic - is repeated the template of many of his own previous films: Best friends fall for the same girl. When she's leaning towards the other guy, what do you do? Sabotage their relationship, what else? If the film doesn't stink, it's because Dhawan's hired an enthusiastic trio of male leads who make the most of the wafer-thin material they're provided. Sid (Ali Zafar), Jai (Siddharth), and Omi (Divyendu Sharma) are roommates sharing a rented home in Goa. Ever the slackers, Jai and Omi spend their days pawing girls and cracking lewd jokes. When their attempts to land the new girl in town (Tapsee Pannu) fall flat, they're hell-bent on making sure Sid doesn't succeed where they failed. The dialogues are pedestrian but the actors - particularly Siddharth and Divyendu - often make them work because of their sharp timing. The entire film, in fact, hinges purely on the chemistry of the boys, who ride over many of the script contrivances. The same, unfortunately, can't be said of the leading lady who exudes the charm of an ice cube. In the Lallan Miyan role from Paranjpye's film, Dhawan casts a heavily tattooed, motorbike-riding Rishi Kapoor as the owner of a nearby restaurant whom our heroes permanently owe money to. He has a nice romantic track with Lilette Dubey who plays the boys' landlady. Still, the new 'Chashme Baddoor' doesn't entirely work because Dhawan appears conflicted between taking the characters on a journey of his making, and sticking to the blueprint of the original film. Much of the final act involving a fake kidnapping feels too na? in a modern story, and Dhawan can't seem to skillfully adapt the simple plot turns of the earlier film to his current day version. If you're willing to leave the memory of the earlier film at the door, there's a chance you might enjoy the rat-a-tat sparring between the leads, and you might even find yourself chuckling at some of the crude humour. I'm going with two-and-a-half out of five for David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor. Like junk food, it has no nutritional value. But an occasional bite doesn't hurt.</Review>

Either a) a filmmaker wants to recreate the success of the original or b) wants to better it so that it gets the due it never did or c) because he wants to remind the audience its forgotten virtues. But after watching David Dhawan*s remake of Sai Paranjpye*s 1981 classic, I have come up with a few more alternatives, which certainly apply on Chashme Baddoor -- Bollywood is lazy, out of ideas and so darn cocky. So while filmmakers have no qualms about ripping or remaking verified hits, they cannot resist this urge to improvise and show their true calibre in the process. Only last week, Sajid Khan came out with Himmatwala, also a remake, where the source is unapologetically pedestrian and so it*s hardly surprising if its reproduction is even shoddier. Moreover, its exaggerated tone resonates with Khan*s sensibilities. Dhawan has no excuse. Paranjpye*s film is a master class in deft writing, the manner in which she seamlessly combines buddy humour and young romance while noting the minute but colourful details that add zing to day-to-day life and casual conversations. Her artistry lies in making all those extensive inputs appear so deceptively simple. When a director has access to this much imagination, he ought to show a lot more responsibility than Dhawan does. Loud in sight, sound and sense, this Chashme Battering is an assault to the original with its line-up of gaudy aesthetics (think Rohit Shetty*s All The Best), actors hamming to the hilt in boxers and ghastly, GHASTLY writing. The beating begins from the word go. In the first scene itself, one gets a fair idea of the level of competence to expect after Omi (Divyendu Sharma) recites this poem:  Kashmir na koi le sakta hai. Kashmir na koi de sakta hai. Kashmir mein sirf teen din, do raat ka package ho sakta hai. Joke? Erm. Cut to Siddharth*s Jai nearly molesting a woman at an audition. Joke? He*s method acting. And then there*s Seema (Taapsee Pannu), thank god they renamed Deepti Naval*s character, an annoying Bollywood stereotype who throws needless tantrums, smiles vacuously and dresses up like Tennis Barbie. The setting has shifted from Delhi to Goa and the boys are jobless as ever and find a common *shikaar* in Seema but expectedly get thrashed -- her beagle bites Omi*s butt, her grandmother (Bharti Achrekar) whips the life out of Jai. Then there*s Mr Nice Guy (wearing a different set of glasses in every few scenes) Siddharth (Ali Zafar) who*s, frankly, no better than his chums. When not dancing about Goa with his cronies to bombastic songs (Sajid-Wajid), this unemployed bloke meets prospective brides on his mother*s insistence. Somewhere in this wishy-washy scheme of things, Dhawan finds the space (and gall) to fit in a forced romance between a certain Joseph  (Rishi Kapoor) and Josephine (Lilette Dubey)  -- yes, the done-to-death gag that aspires to tickle over the lovey-dovey interactions of an elderly duo. Love sees no age *only courage, bondage, cleavage and marriage,* we are told. It*s a sad day at the movies when the iconic Chamko scene is butchered while these two fine actors embarrass themselves.  I never thought I*d say this but Rishi Kapoor, what were you thinking? And Lilette Dubey, she is now officially the brand ambassador of the single, sexy, sophisticated spinster club with her umpteenth portrayal of the same. If the outcome of a remake is to affront everything the original represents then WHY ON EARTH call it Chashme Baddoor? Why not simply write your own story about three random friends, name it something like Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada and then include every Tom, Dick, Joseph, Josephine, Beagle, Fattu, Gattu as you please? To be fair, even though I was not too kicked about the remake, I tried not to be prejudiced reminding myself of one of Dhawan*s cleanest films -- Hero No 1. The latter too, took unabashed inspiration from another beloved classic (Hrishikesh Mukherjee*s Bawarchi) and the final product was pretty decent.  Guess Govinda isn't given enough credit for making it work. Neither of the young guys in Chashme Baddoor have his timing or verve. Siddharth plays Ravi Baswani like Shakti Kapoor. His enthusiasm oscillates between funny and phony. Like those badly written shers he mouths, Sharma, too, never takes off.  Zafar is notches down from his over-the-top act in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan but a goofy smile and an on-screen chemistry with the heroine that screams *phoos* does nothing for him. Besides that one pre-interval scene, most of their antics and brotherhood looks as genuine as Bharti Achrekar*s more salt, less pepper wig. Achrekar, god bless her shrieking lungs, is caricatured after Salman Khan*s slap-launching mom in Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya. Dhawan, in fact, references a whole lot of his films here. From a framed photo of Anupam Kher in his armyman getup in Shola Aur Shabnam, to the cast romping about What is mobile number (Haseena Maan Jayegi) and Tu tu tu tara (Bol Radha Bol). Also, be prepared to witness one of the most yawn-inducing parodies of Saajan*s Dekha hai pehli baar. The original*s director Lawrence D*Souza did a far superior job of spoofing old Hindi songs picturised on Anupam Kher and Madhuri Dixit in Dil Tera Aashiq. Quoting the late film critic Roger Ebert from his review of the Total Recall remake, *It never touched me emotionally, though, the way the 1990 (1981 in this case) film did, and strictly speaking, isn't necessary.* Unnecessary is right. During one of the songs, I saw a board that reads, *Please don't touch artefacts.* I rest my case.</Review>

The three boys were strenuously playing their parts, which ran on the expected 'ladki- pe- line-maarna and- juvenile-jokes- crack karna' tracks. The lines were cheesy but briskly executed, and the pace just as brisk, the way David Dhawan used to manage it back when he made zippy comedies filled with laugh-out-loud gags. Yes, this was a copy of Sai Paranjpye's classic feel-good 1981 romance Chashme Buddoor, even though back then it was called simply a 'family entertainer'. Yes, it was sacrilege, all this remake-'shemake' business, even if it was wrapped nobly in the guise of bringing a beloved story to an audience not born when the film first came out. But David Dhawan in his good days had his own way of making us laugh, and who knew, this could turn out to be a rib-tickler, inimitable DD style. I was quite prepared to see it as a film on its own, and when it began and picked up pace after a couple of hiccups, it seemed as if it was going to succeed. The vibe was youthful, and the trio plus the girl of their dreams were trying hard, and the laughs were flowing. Sid, Jai and Omi (Zafar, Siddharth and Divyendu) are transplanted from the original's early 80s Delhi to today's Goa. Instead of a genial 'paanwaala', they perpetually owe money to a heavily- tattooed caf?wner Joseph Furtado (Kapoor) as well as to their landlady, Miss Josephine (Dubey). A romantic thread between Kapoor and Dubey is an add-on, and it starts with a smile, but these old-timers end up making you groan because they are responsible for ruining an iconic moment from the original. And that is how the film pans out soon after the spry beginning, leaving you wincing. Because Dhawan's film is a series of forced contrivances, not a story that grows out of a place and time. His characters don't feel like they are good friends who live together. They feel like they have just come together for the shot. Neither do they mesh well, nor do they work Individually as well as they should: Ali Zafar's laid back tone is all too familiar, Divyendu is not half as funny as he was in his debut, Pyaar Ka Punchnama, and the very energetic Siddharth contorts himself a bit too much. Taapsee is the only one who feels real, and stays likeable despite the occasional fumble with lines. The seasoned supporting cast is ill-used. Anupam Kher has been like this in too many movies. Bharti Achrekar can do better than go about administering slaps on assorted faces, that dreadful running thread in so many Dhawan outings. But it is Rishi Kapoor one feels most for: as a biker with a mobile waist-and-heart, he should have been one of the best things about the film. But except a move or two on the dance floor, Kapoor doesn't have a true moment. And his caf?called 'Nostalgia', becomes an ironic descriptor, making us long for the original (Sai Paranjype's Chashme Buddoor is also out in theatres today : do watch if you haven't already).</Review>

Any resemblance to anything sensible is purely coincidental. Any resemblance to the original film Sai Paranjpye made in 1981 is foolish. Being a remake, Dhawan's 2013 update was bound to bear similarity as far as the story goes. For everything else, the new film is as different from the old one as junk food is from a veggie thali served in a family restaurant. Going by his last two dud releases, Rascals and Do Knot Disturb, Dhawan is clearly out of ideas these days. Hence the ploy to remake a cult comedy hit. Perhaps it was meant to be an impish signal, but Dhawan has changed the spelling of the second word in the film's title. Paranjpye's Chashme Buddoor becomes Chashme Baddoor here. As 'bud' gets 'bad', a familiar tale of buddy bonding that seemed so innocent three decades ago acquires the trademark David Dhawan corny twist. Dhawan reorients Paranjpye's middle-of-the-road idiom to suit his brand of slapstick. The package is deceptively trendy - obviously to woo the urban youth - but you do not miss the filmmaker's well-known slant at pleasing the masses all along. Ali Zafar, Siddharth and Divyendu Sharma play Sid, Jai and Omi - three friends who share a small house. To pump up the glamour quotient this remake moves to Goa (the setting of the original film was Delhi). Jai and Omi are basically no-gooders whose full-time occupation seems to be chasing girls. Sid is more focussed about life. You know what follows if you have seen the original film. Jai and Omi spot a pretty girl in the neighbourhood (Tapsee Pannu). The bumbling fools try their luck with her and fail. The girl Seema falls for Sid. The two jealous friends now try to bust the love story. Dhawan's remake retains the basic storyline of the original and all that follows, with a few inclusions to make it whackier for GenNow tastes. The languid feel of Paranjpye's effort is traded for more energetic vibes but the humour often seems forced. The gags - many of them SMS jokes that might have popped into your inbox from time to time - are simply not funny enough even if you are game to grant the licence of brainlessness. Dhawan has always been a master of spoofs, known especially for using hit songs to create humour out of situations that may come across as intense in an otherwise clichéd potboiler. He taps the formula again in Chashme Baddoor, but his choice of songs - from the '80s and the '90s - seems a bit jaded. A good part of the film has to be its dialogues. Sajid-Farhad's lines, loaded with tapori shayari, do the trick, often taking otherwise lame scenes to another level. Of the three leads, Siddharth as the filmy freak Jai outshines the others with his natural comic timing. The other winner is Rishi Kapoor as Mr Joseph. The character is an update on Saeed Jaffery's friendly neighbourhood paanwallah Lallan Miyan in the 1981 flick. Unlike Jaffery, who had a cameo, Kapoor's is a more fleshed-out supporting role. Joseph gets his quota of naach-gaana and a Miss Josephine (Lilette Dubey) too, to cover sizeable runtime. Tapsee Pannu tries cutting a picture of zest as Seema, but her role - like all the others in this film - is too flippant to let her impress. There are two ways you would enjoy this film: Either you haven't seen the original, or if you are sporting enough not to compare.</Review>

But if you thought, at least by his apology of a last film Rascals, that he has lost his hand at his own genre then wait back for the filmmaker tries once again to appease his mass, this time around with a remake of one of the most endearing cult comedies Chashme Baddoor. Does it work? Let's find out. Omi (Divyendu Sharma) has shayris one worse than the other at the tip of his tongue, Jai (Siddharth) considers himself no less than the Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) of Sholay. Both rakes and compulsive flirts set their eyes on Seema (Taapse Pannu) and try to outwit each other to woo her. However, their attempts all fail severely. In the meantime, their rather gentle and reticent friend Siddharth aka Sid (Ali Zafar) scores with the girl in an instant. Green with envy, the two then try to separate them. What happens to the couple follows through the rest of the plot. David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor is a far cry from the Sai Paranjpe classic. Its basic premise may just be the same but the screenplay gets re-written completely to give in for a new film altogether. But the question is how many has Hindi cinema seen men outsmarting each other to woo one girl? Many. Even Dhawan's own films amongst the staggering count of 40 have had the formula applied generously. So to say there's a tinge of novelty in the film it would be wrong. While the original was subtle and simple, the remake is loud almost to the point of being raucous and also extremely fast paced. There's way too much happening at every given point aided with either the ear splitting background score or the jarring decible levels of the actors. David has made efforts to make the story more new age, young and fresh however, in the process has also stripped it off its charm. The humour for most parts in the film is extremely slapstick and straight out of SMS PJs. But there are some geniunely funny ones and even some lame ones too that make you laugh despite yourself. The filmmaker also gives a spin to the character of Lallan Miyan played by Saeed Jaffery in the original by introducing Rishi Kapoor as Joseph Furtado. The love angle between Rishi Kapoor and Lilette Dubey, although endearingly portrayed, isn't new to the eyes and hence doesn't leave an impact. On the acting front all three actors Siddhart, Divyendu Sharma and Ali Zafar bow to the script requirements and ham, exaggerate and go over the top at every scene. Taapse too is just about okay and blends into the antics quite well. The season stars Rishi Kapoor and Lilette Dubey act brilliantly. Music by Sajid Wajid has ample hooklines but it doesn't quite stay with the listener. To sum it up, Chashme Baddoor is yet another slapstick affair by David Dhawan and doesn't leave you in splits as it should.</Review>
      <Review Id="133" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/chashme-baddoor-movie-review-799" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="4th April, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="2/5">Don't judge a film by its poster, a bright spark on the screen reminds the audience rather helpfully. We know, buddy. But what if the book turns out to be worse than the cover? Actually, it isn't quite that simple out here either way: neither the poster nor the film is worth wasting any considered judgment on. David Dhawan*s Chashme Baddoor is a raggedy bag of gags as flimsy as the boxers that the three buddies strut around in * they are full of colour all right but add little value to the canvas. Intended to be a breezy comic romp, the film is woefully short of wind in its sails despite all the bluff and bluster that it whips up. The cult classic of 1981 that is still vividly etched in our collective memories receives the OTT Double D (over the top David Dhawan) treatment but isn't even half the fun that Sai Paranjpye*s witty and infectiously mirthful Chashme Buddoor was. Note the difference in spelling. Dhawan spells Baddoor with an *a* * it adds up to too *bad* and too far gone to be genuinely enjoyable. Paranjpye had settled for a *u* in her Buddoor * her film had instant *universal* appeal. This ill-advised remake is less adult than asinine. Watch Chashme Baddoor by all means if you nurture no reverence for Hindi cinema*s past, for whatever it is worth. Watch it for all the frenzied dancing, prancing and romancing that Dhawan unleashes to the accompaniment of Hindi film hits of the none-too-distant past, in addition to a slew of new musical numbers. For this critic, Chashme Baddoor does evoke a degree of nostalgia but not quite in the way one would expect. You hear SP Balasubramanyam*s robust voice in a snatch of Dekha hai pehli baar and how you long for a return to the era of the great male singers who sounded male and not like some of the nasal, effeminate, monotonous wonders that rule the roost today! Ali Zafar, the film*s lead actor who gets to sing a solitary peppy love ditty, comes pretty close to the tonal timbre of those great voices that once defined Hindi movie music. Unfortunately, amid the high-pitched din that this Chashme Baddoor delivers, these little delights are but stray straws in a wild gust. So, if you can't stand the unseemly sight of a pristine idea being mauled, battered and pulverized out of shape and beyond recognition, do yourself a favour and stay away from this laboured, loud and lowbrow rehash of a truly magnificent comedy. As a matter of fact, Chashme Baddoor doesn't deserve to be designated as a remake: it demolishes much more than it actually makes. Dhawan and his scriptwriter leave the core of the original storyline intact but tamper cavalierly with its essence. The result is anything but salutary. They yank the bum chums away from their culture-specific Delhi location and transport them to an indeterminate Goan setting. In the bargain, all prospects of carving a genuinely funny caper flick out of the material are driven to the ground and many feet under. It is one thing to seek to update a comic love story from a bygone era for present times. It*s quite another to trifle with its spirit. Chashme Baddoor goes completely go off the rails in trying to eke out a laugh-a-minute ride by resorting to methods that one thought had gone out of currency with Govinda. Yes, there is something unconscionably twisted and misplaced about this Chashme Baddoor. The antics of the motor-mouth male trio at the centre of the rigmarole * Sid (Ali Zafar), Jai (Siddharth) and Omi (Divyendu Sharma) * border on the imbecile, and the one-liners that they direct at each other and at the world at large are delivered at decibel levels so high that that it could rattle even those that are hard of hearing. Sid is an introverted goody two-shoes who believes in playing safe, but his two pals * one a wannabe poet who spouts irritatingly silly rhymes, the other a movie-crazy city slacker in love with the idea of who he is * are incorrigible skirt-chasers who repeatedly land in trouble. One gets bitten on the rump by a frisky canine; the other gets whipped by a feisty granny. The trauma drives them over the edge and they lose all sense of what*s good for them. The duo is perfect advertisement for a film that has no clue where it is going. The girl that they are out to woo, Seema (Taapsee Pannu), is no coy touch-me-not. On the run from an armyman dad (Anupam Kher) who wants her to marry a soldier, she seeks refuge in the Goa home of her civilian uncle (Anupam Kher again) and her spirited grandmother (Bharti Achrekar). The mayhem that ensues as a result of a series of mistaken identities and misadventures has a deleterious effect on Chashme Baddoor * it goes from bad to worse. Everyone, including a cafe owner called Joseph Furtado (Rishi Kapoor) and the object of his late-blooming desire, ageing spinster Josephine (Lilette Dubey), jumps into the pool of uncertainty. Subtlety certainly isn't the name of the game here. Wit is replaced by runaway buffoonery. As the humour assumes crude, if not lewd, overtones, the actors take the cue and ham away to glory. But to their credit, they shriek, holler, run around in circles and make a spectacle of themselves and yet manage to stay on their feet for the most part. Wish one could say the same about the film as a whole. If the original was a soothing and timeless melody, this is a raucous and forgettable item number. Give it a shot if you must, but don't expect the world from it.</Review>

This version's as different as paapri chaat from a dhokla. But it retains the original's madness, masti and movie-mania. The remixed CB unrolls in Goa where phatichar shayar Omi (Sharma) is addressing, ahem, the St. Stephens College of Arts and Science, while wanna-be hero Jai (Siddharth) is over-acting into a rape scene. Watching the dolts in full bloom, CB has you chuckling from the start. Things only get better when sober Sid (Zafar) pops up, yodels with his cheap chums and explains their drought of dough to doughty cafe owner Joseph Futado (Kapoor) and landlady Josephine (Dubey). Meanwhile, Seema (Pannu) is escaping an arranged marriage, scooting towards the three idiots. Love happens - but after lust, lies and lots of laughs. CB's boy-band impresses with consistent acting. With his silky sleaziness, Sharma often steals the show while Siddharth's comic rhythm is a revelation. Zafar is endearing with his clenched-jaw charm, graceful as he dances, cute as he romances and rather hot when he throws a punch or two. Pannu's bubbly without being overwhelming while Kapoor and Dubey light up the screen with their little love story - hardcore CB fans, you'll find their romance does chamko! But the star remains the story, spicily modernized, yet its salt still that passion for filmi fun, rainy moments, shared chattris, judwaa bhais, overpowering Ma's, red coats-yellow pants (Dhawan clearly enjoying a Govinda flashback), cheap shers, cheaper lusts and triumphant love. CB's music is catchy, its lines too - "Bomb woh thi, blast main ho gaya!" - while the hilarity underlines the wise adage: friends stab you in the front but good friendship deserves chashme buddoor. Watch it zaroor.</Review>

RANGREZZ. HIMMATWALA. Now CHASHME BADDOOR. I've often been asked, is there a paucity of ideas in Bollywood? Why do dream merchants opt for remakes? Why not inventive concepts? Additionally, a lot of cineastes strongly feel classics should not be tampered with. For, rarely has a remake surpassed the original, in terms of content. In the process, those opting for remakes have lost credibility when comparisons are made... Now David Dhawan steps into the revered territory with CHASHME BADDOOR, a film attempted by Sai Paranjpye more than three decades ago. CHASHME BADDOOR is loved for its simplistic plot, wittiness and slice of life realism. A story of three friends who fall in love with the same girl and the confusion that ensues... Sure, David borrows from the original, but the humor in his version is in your face, over the top, flamboyant... it's simply wild, when you compare it with Sai's version. Does it mean it's more entertaining or a hodgepodge of the cult classic? Let's analyse... CHASHME BADDOOR narrates the story of three friends [Ali Zafar, Siddharth, Divyendu Sharma], who attempt to woo the same girl [Taapsee Pannu]. While the girl sets her sights on one of the guys, the remaining two go on an overdrive to tear the love birds apart. At the very outset, let me make it clear that David's adaptation is shades different from Sai's version. As different as chalk and cheese. As different as Rohit Shetty's BOL BACHCHAN was from its original source, Hrishikesh Mukherjee's GOL MAAL. Like I stated at the outset, this one's over the top, loud and very 'David Dhawanish', if one can use this terminology. But to give the credit where it's due, it's thoroughly engaging and entertaining. David has made a career out of comedies and at a point of time, was referred to as the successor to Manmohan Desai thanks to the dollops of entertainment he offered in his movies. With CHASHME BADDOOR, David steps into the comfort zone yet again. There's no denying that the humour he injects in this one is not aimed at the purists, but the spectator of today, who may not be as complaining purely because of the laughs and entertainment it has to offer. Besides, David ensures that there's hardly any dull moment in the present-day adaptation. He executes the film with a certain ease, opting for amusing punch lines, wild situations and mad and crazy episodes. The game of one-upmanship that was evident in his earlier works, namely DEEWANA MASTANA [Anil Kapoor, Govinda fighting for Juhi Chawla's attention] and MUJHSE SHAADI KAROGE [Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar's attempts to impress Priyanka Chopra] is very evident in CHASHME BADDOOR as well. The battle of wits is enjoyable for sure. But there are times when certain episodes appear prolonged and the jokes fall flat. The intent of making you laugh does not come across as strongly in few portions. Besides, the soundtrack is absolutely in sync with the content, but the placement of songs could be more appropriate. However, the usage of popular songs in the flashback portions is refreshingly different. Sajid-Farhad's dialogue are aimed at evoking laughs and they serve the purpose. The one-liners, especially those delivered by Siddharth and Divyendu, are hilarious. Cinematography [Sanjay F. Gupta] captures the colourful setting well. Now to the performances! Ali Zafar gives a wonderful account of himself as he lights up every sequence he features in. Siddharth does a complete turnaround from the roles he has portrayed in Hindi films [RANG DE BASANTI, STRIKER], handling his part with gusto. Divyendu Sharma, who debuted in PYAAR KA PUNCHNAMA, too does an about-turn this time. He slips into his part most effortlessly. Taapsee Pannu, who makes her debut in Hindi movies after acting in South Indian language movies, is vivacious and confident. Rishi Kapoor gets a complete makeover in CHASHME BADDOOR and he's damn adorable in sequences with Lillete. Anupam Kher lets himself go completely and is absolutely wild in dual roles. Lillete Dubey is super, while Bharti Achrekar [as Taapsee's grand-mom] is loveable. Ayaz Khan has nothing much to do. On the whole, CHASHME BADDOOR encompasses the spirit of the original, but has been customised to entice the present-day spectators. An entertainer with dollops of humour and wild situations thrown in, this one's a laugh-riot that should not be missed!</Review>

A lot has been written and spoken on how they*re serving the same old stuff without it even being as good or bad as the originals. But David Dhawan*s remake of Sai Paranjpye*s Chashme Baddoor is the perfect example for paraphrasing a catchy song from the film itself. Har ek remake kamini nahi hoti. This borderline adult comedy and slapstick fiesta is surprisingly fun. It*s loud, brash and irreverent unlike its original inspiration. But it*s as much worthy of a watch. The basic story is the same. There are three friends sharing a rented apartment. They*re students and they*re broke. Siddharth (Ali Zafar), Jai (Siddharth) and Omi (Divyendu Sharma) are scrapping the bottom of the barrel to eke out a colourful life. Jai and Omi are the kaminas while Siddharth is the one with his thoughts and emotions on the sleeve. Enter Seema and the three friends indulge in some friendly and unfriendly rivalry to win her affections. It*s from there that Dhawan*s film deviates from the original and takes to the vivid path of cheesy dialogue, double entendres and silly gags. Even its outlandish comedy-of-errors climax is a far cry from subtle or situational comedy. But the most important fact is it works. Sajid-Farad*s crazy and double meaning dialogue is a highlight. Anupam Kher in a double role and Rishi Kapoor as a charming Goan entrepreneur add to the charm as well. Chashme Baddoor is shot in Goa and Mauritius and it looks fresh and colourful. The setting adds a nice punch to the film*s screenplay. David Dhawan is back to his best. His narrative keeps jumping back to *90s hits like What*s your mobile number? (Haseena Maan Jayegi) and Tu tu tu... tu tu tara (Bol Radha Bol) and it creates a perfect mood for the film. Silly comedies work best when they don't take themselves seriously and Dhawan knows it best. One up on the film*s direction is its actors. Seasoned performers like Rishi Kapoor and Anupam Kher prove why they*re still goldmines of talent, younger actors Divyendu Sharma and Ali Zafar showcase their own comedic timing. Zafar particularly does well adding a modern and edgy twist to a character that belonged to Farooque Shaikh. Taapsee Pannu performs well and looks like a dream. But the breakthrough performer is Siddharth. He leans into a lewd and crass character and makes it as much appealing as it*s funny. Of course his great printed wardrobe adds to Siddharth*s over-the-top performance. Chashme Baddoor is a classic example of how remakes should be done. It*s not just a pat representation. It*s a tweaked and updated version of the original. Back in 1981 kurtas, university students and situational comedy worked wonders. In 2013 campy humour works best. And best part is Chashme Baddoor serves it unapologetically while still accommodating the touches of the original. Chamko detergent (a memorable part of the original movie) makes a cameo, tongue firmly in cheek.</Review>

And I have never been a David Dhawan fan. I spent the 90s avoiding the raucous comedies that Dhawan produced in quick succession, most successfully with Govinda * Aankhen, Raja Babu, Banarasi Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan. The only David Dhawan film I can remember laughing rather than cringing at is Hero No. 1, where Dhawan remade another classic of our quietly funny *middle class cinema*- Bawarchi. And Dhawan*s 2011 release, Rascals, starring Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt and the unfortunate Kangana Ranaut*s cleavage, was among the most distressingly sexist, grotesquely tasteless films of the year. A still from David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor A still from David Dhawan*s Chashme Baddoor. Image courtesy: FB page. So I went into David Dhawan*s remake of Sai Paranjpye*s classic expecting to abhor it. Imagine my surprise that I did not, and then my shock when I found that I was thoroughly enjoying myself. The secret of this success is probably that Dhawan*s film, from its very first frames, manages to make you forget that what you*re watching has anything to do with Paranjpye*s film. The plot is fundamentally the same: two womanising slackers try to woo the lovely new girl next door; they fail magnificently, but make up grand fake stories about their conquest. When they discover their seedha-saada friend has gotten involved with the girl who didn't give them a second glance, their youthful masculine egos demand that they break up the jodi. But this is a film from a different planet. It is neither delicate nor subtle nor adorably, ridiculously romantic in the way that the old Chashme Buddoor will always be. The old Chashme Buddoor is irreplaceable. But this new film * deliberately raucous, garishly colourful, masterfully kitschy * has such a relentless supply of energy and silliness and PJs that it is remarkably hard to resist. It*s like that unstoppable cousin of yours who keeps making terrible, groan-worthy jokes that you feel you really shouldn't laugh at * but he tells them with such enthusiasm and pitch-perfect timing that you simply cannot keep a straight face. The penchant for bad shairi of the Omi character (Rakesh Bedi in the original) is retained for Dibyendu (last seen ranting against womankind in Pyaar ka Punchnama), and he keeps up a barrage of relentlessly low-brow, often deeply politically incorrect humour. The film opens with Dibyendu standing on the stage of his alma mater, *St. Stephen*s College of Arts and Sciences* (ha!), located * where else? * in Goa, and declaiming: *Kashmir na koi le sakta hai, Kashmir na koi de sakta hai/ Kashmir mein bas teen din aur do raat ka honeymoon package ho sakta hai*. And it just carries on from there, one phatichar line after another: from *Bomb woh thhi, blast main ho gaya* to *Main aapke door ka padosi hoon*. Meanwhile, the Jai character (Ravi Baswani in the original) is played to hilarious excess by Siddharth Suryanarayan (last seen in Striker, first seen by Hindi film audiences in Rang de Basanti). Siddharth throws himself into his impromptu renditions of nineties numbers, from *Tu tu tu tara, phans gaya dil bechara* to *It*s raining* with supreme OTT abandon * and his genuine enjoyment of it all is really quite infectious. There is one disgusting, offensive non-joke * involving a voluptuous Lilette Dubey giving a beggar money because he*s starved for three days and saying to herself, I wish I had that much self-control. Poverty is not, repeat * not, never, funny. But other than that one irredeemable moment, inexplicably for dialogue-writers Sajid-Farhad * who*re the real spine of the 100-crore club, having written the dialogues of Housefull 2, Bol Bachchan, Ready, Singham * this film*s humour is not toxic. No, it doesn't challenge or push the mainstream understanding of anything, but it steers clear of being offensive, and it keeps you smiling non-stop. Saeed Jaffrey*s marvelous Lallan Mian, a paanwalla who doles out love-life advice to the boys in the original, is replaced here with Rishi Kapoor*s caf?wning Joseph Furtado, who gets to have his own romance with the boys* fetching-and-still-single landlady, Lilette Dubey as Miss Josephine. In a fascinating shift, that the boys of 2013 * unlike the boys of 1981 * don't think they have anything to learn from an older man. In fact it is he who is the innocent, and they who will set him up with a romantic partner. To complete the arc of that transformation, the film transposes much of the bumbling of the original Farooqe Shaikh character onto Rishi Kapoor * and even gives the Chamko detergent sequence away to the older generation romance. The inherently domestic touch of detergent * charming as it was * cannot taint the carefree gadding about of Ali Zafar (playing Farooque Shaikh*s character) and his bike-riding ladylove Tapasree Pannu. It*s the romance between Tapasee*s Seema and Ali Zafar*s Siddharth (now of course there are no Siddharths left in the Bollywood universe, so he*s Sid) which feels a little thanda. Tapasree is a ten-film-old actress down South, whom I have seen play a very different character in the fascinating Tamil film Aadukalam. She brings an infectious joie-de-vivre to her role as the girl running away from her authoritarian army-man father and the arranged marriage he wishes her to quickmarch her into. (The army man father and his teacher twin give us a double role from Anupam Kher, who seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself delivering such brilliant rubbish as *Lahaul vila kuwwat* I said, Lahaul, via Kuwait*.) Tapasee*s Seema is straightforward and satisfyingly un-coy, and this totally works for her role as the girl whose singular form of appreciation for her man*s charms is to say, *Dum hai, boss!* with an attractive gleam in her eye. But there was a girlishness to Deepti Naval, an old-world demureness she managed to combine with more than the requisite gumption. That, and the purity of Farooque Shaikh*s surprise that a lovely girl like her can really be in love with him * we do not have those. But, as I have said before and I will say again, one should not go into this film with thoughts of the tender romance and impish humour that made the 1981 Chashme Buddoor such a perfect encapsulation of both its time and its director*s marvelous sensibility. The new film may not be a classic, but it is undeniably a fascinating creature * a well-acted, crazily high-octane comedy whose sense of pastiche bears the un-mistakable directorial stamp of David Dhawan. It has the simplicity of the 1981 plot, remade with all the oopari coolness of 2013 * but also, at its core, a laughing, deliberate, gloriously musical homage to the high-decibel, lowbrow humour of Bollywood*s 1990s. Fun stuff.</Review>

The film is an excruciating experience. It begins with a close-up of a disco ball, and it*s downhill from there. I have very little memory of the original 1983 blockbuster, but this remake is so painful that I longed for Sridevi, Jeetendra and his trademark white shoes.http://www.hindustantimes.com/Images/popup/2013/3/Himmatwala-song.jpg Director and co-writer Sajid Khan isn't spoofing the *80s. He*s celebrating and recreating the decade. So we have the coughing mother, the sister who almost gets raped, the shrewish heroine who is inevitably tamed, and a despotic villain named Sher Singh, who is the sarpanch of a village called Ramnagar. The villagers live in quiet desperation, until the Himmatwala, Ravi (played by Ajay Devgn), shows up. Of course, in keeping with another *80s tradition, the word Himmatwala is repeated every half hour. Himmatwala is loud, puerile and so unfunny that it hurts. Sajid and his dialogue writers, Farhad-Sajid, cheerfully give us lines like *Usse itna rula de ki woh hasna bhool jaye*. Early in the film, the heroine, the sarpanch*s spoilt daughter, declares: *I hate garibs*. A song includes the lyrics: *Maar uske bum pe laat jo tujhe daraata hai*. In one spectacularly tedious moment, we get a spoof of the shower scene from Psycho. And just when you think it can't get worse, Sajid springs a scene in which Mahesh Manjrekar (the sarpanch) and Paresh Rawal (his brother-in-law) are snuggling, spoon-position, in bed and it is suggested that Paresh*s hand has been resting in an inappropriate place. When Himmatwala ended, I felt like I had aged a few years. Honestly, you need real courage to brave this one.</Review>

Director Sajid Khan's pot pourri of excessive melodrama, puerile humor, cartoonish action, and garish songs plods on for two-and-a-half hours with little concern for your bladder or your mental health. The all-new 'Himmatwala' has many of the same problems that plagued the earlier film, and a few new ones of its own. Chief among these is its inability to decide what it wants to be - an honest remake, evocative of the tone and spirit of those 80s 'Madras potboilers', or a tongue-in-cheek spoof of that very genre. Ajay Devgn is Ravi, our nostril-flaring hero who returns to the village of his birth seeking vengeance on the man who destroyed his family. Sher Singh (Mahesh Manjrekar) is the gentleman in question, although his actions are most ungentlemanly. He's the oppressive, land-grabbing sarpanch of the village who's instilled fear in the hearts of locals. To be honest, Sajid Khan doesn't so much direct, as he launches an assault on our senses with a string of tired cliches you thought you'd seen the last of - the hero's widowed mother who repeatedly binds him in a 'maa ki kasam', his unfortunate sister who only exists to be raped by the villain's henchmen and tortured by her in-laws, the villain's spoilt but good-hearted daughter who falls for the hero much to her father's disdain, and even an old foe who turns up at a crucial moment to help the hero in return for sparing his life earlier...that character, by the way, is played by a tiger! But 'Himmatwala' is intended as much as a comedy as it is a revenge saga, even if the humor alternates between regressive and plain pedestrian. Sher Singh's daughter (Telugu star Tamannah) carries around a whip and declares: "I hate gareebs!". Paresh Rawal, playing Sher Singh's sidekick brother-in-law is always ready with an obvious pun. The only genuinely clever bit is a black-and-white spoof on the infamous shower scene from Psycho, but it's too smart for this film. Packed from start to finish with too many underwhelming action scenes, and song sequences that pale in comparison to Jeetendra and Sridevi's matka-jhatkas, the new 'Himmatwala' is a busy, crowded film but one that's deathly dull in the final reckoning. So predictable and boring in fact, that Rohit Shetty's films feel like Citizen Kane in comparison. Amidst the sea of hammy performances, it's Ajay Devgn, expectedly, who manages not to entirely embarrass himself. He pummels the bad guys competently, and carries off some of the film's corny lines without tripping. But it's such a shame to watch this reliable, robust performer reduce himself to appearing in this drivel. I'm going with one out of five for director Sajid Khan's 'Himmatwala'. The movie opens with a disco song featuring Sonakshi Sinha that goes: "Thank God, it's Friday!" Not this Friday, believe me.</Review>
      <Review Id="140" Name="Sukanya Verma" Expected="" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-himmatwala-is-good-for-one-time-laughs/20130329.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="29th March, 2013" Likes="" Rating="2/5">Couple of weeks back, my neighbour and I were chatting about upcoming Bollywood films and he completely dismissed the probability of watching Sajid Khan*s Himmatwala. His six-year-old daughter overheard this and at once protested, *But I want to watch it and I will whether you like it or not.* Few days later, I watched a television interview where the audacious filmmaker notes, *My films appeal to kids between the age of five to ten.* Clearly, the man really knows his target turnout. One kid*s approval amounts to selling three tickets since he/she will be accompanied by his parents, willingly or otherwise. And while I give him full marks for insight, it doesn't always translate into great films. He doesn't care, of course. He hasn't had to. Understanding the pulse of an easily-pleased audience alone has led to booming business for all his films like Heyy Babyy, Housefull and Housefull 2. Who knows, thirty years from now Aakhri Pasta is heralded as an iconic figure in pop culture and Imma Joking T-shirts might actually give Being Human a run for their money. (Gee, I may be exhibiting some side effects after watching Himmatwala. Damn ticket didn't carry any disclaimer. Not even in fine print.) While you shudder at the prospect, here*s the dope on the laughable hence watchable Himmatwala. The original came out in 1983 on this very day but I don't have any memory of it. (Neither does Tammanah. She was born six years later.) The only thing I remember about that year is Sunny Deol strutting about his farmhouse with a magnificent horse and adorable Labrador in tow. (But they*re not remaking it. Yet. So, phew. And yay.) Anyway, I revisited the Jeetendra-Sridevi starrer again recently for the sake of this article. Barring Kader Khan*s (whom I admire unconditionally for sheer cheek) geography-dependent humour, dotty camaraderie with a rifle-toting Amjad Khan and Sri-Jeetu*s sprightly jhatka-matkas to loony lyrics, I didn't find Himmatwala anything more than a formulaic masala about oppressive village landlords being taught a lesson, spoilt rich shrews begging to be tamed, destitute mother-sister duo with an ever-ready supply of glycerine and a string of jarring sub-plots to prolong its third act. Obviously, Sajid Khan will not agree. He loved it immensely and watched the movie repeatedly in Juhu*s Chandan theatre (One of the best places, along with Gaiety/Galaxy theatre to understand your average viewer*s likes/dislikes). Unlike Karan Johar, however, he didn't have any emotional reason to remake it. Himmatwala, as opposed to Agneepath, was one of the biggest hits of that year. The idea here, I think, is not an upgrade but to go back in time and relive those foolish sensibilities so many filmmakers have painstakingly tried to erase with the hope of promoting entertaining, progressive films. Sarcasm aside, retro is fun but only when offered with levity, chutzpah and an ironic of parody and reverence. His sister Farah (Om Shanti Om, Main Hoon Naa) is a master of this virtue. The new Himmatwala displays this quality but only in spurts and superficially. To Sajid*s credit, he does away with all those congesting sub-plots I was previously whining about to keep the focus solely on Ajay Devgn in and as Himmatwala. So here*s what he does * a) Make a heroic entry inside a fighting arena with blasting electric guitar for introductory score, b) Bend an iron bar with his bare hands to draw attention to the *himmat* in the title, c) Land at Ramnagar and small talk with the reliably hammy Asrani (also in the original), d) Discover his widowed mom (Zarina Wahab) and kid sister (Leena Jumani) doing what every mother-sister duo did if 1980s are to be believed * sew, swab, sweep, scrub, e) Vows revenge against village tyrant Sher Singh (Mahesh Manjerekar)  f) Discipline his I hate gareebs-spewing daughter (Tamannaah) g) Sock a CGI-generated tiger in the jaw h) Win the girl*s heart and free gift voucher to tathaiya tathaiya ho, i) Pay an unexpected tribute to Abbas-Mustan with the proverbial pre-interval *kahani-mein-twist* j) Bash goons of all shape, size and colour to rescue sister*s izzat, win girlfriend*s favour and reaffirm a mother*s vishwaas.  Expectedly, it*s all very over-the-top but here*s the thing. The 1983 one established Jeetendra as a professional, an engineer, a man of purpose striving to bring change within a terribly feudal set-up while engaging a personal vendetta. It didn't always work but the script fuelled his heroism. Devgn, on the other hand, loiters about doing nothing and relies purely on physical might to make an impact. For a man who brags about having so much faith in oneself, he sure wears a lot of stones on his fingers. No matter how many comedies he stars in and how well they do, this genre is not his forte. Nor can he dance. Watching him work those stiff legs and rigid expressions along with the beautiful (but bland) Tammanah to songs that scream for spunk is harrowing. The two have no chemistry with each other or anyone else in the movie.  Previously, Kader Khan, Amjad Khan, Sridevi, Jeetendra, Shakti Kapoor went on to work as a team on several entertainers together and their on screen comfort made the mindlessness a tad more credible.  Speaking of Kader Khan, Himmatwala pays tribute to his trademark quips and mannerisms wholeheartedly through Paresh Rawal*s energetic delivery. If you look past the absurd poodle-inspired hair he*s sporting, the actor does a swell job of capturing the not-nearly-enough-celebrated comedian. Be it the voice, accent or body language as both Himmatwala*s Narayan Shankar and Bajrangi (remember his talk-to-the-camera/viewer gimmick in Ghar Ho Toh Aisa?), Rawal is responsible for all the laughs in the new edition. It takes a sport to kiss Mahesh Manjrekar in the ear and mouth lines like, *Aap gutter hain toh main uska ganda pani hoon.* *Yeh haath hai ya hathoda. Is kidon ke shaher mein kahan se aaya makoda* *Mere paap ke kachre ko, apne imandari ki jhadoo se saaf kar de.* *Shareer ke ek ek hissa chila raha hai Bharat bandh.* When it comes to foolhardiness, this is quite a faithful adaptation. Manjrekar doesn't have Amjad Khan*s aura but he surprises by refusing to be his usual overboard self. With his comic timing, the man could do wonders in a well-written script. He*s genuinely droll in the Aye Aye dining table scene and a spoof on Hitchcock*s Psycho. Sajid Khan loves big scale but the production values of all his films, their aesthetics, g are consistently tacky. Himmatwala is no different. And while he caters to tots when instructing Manjrekar and Rawal to dance like a bunch of goofballs against Ashok Kumar*s rendition of Rail gaadi, he subjects the same spectators to a completely needless rape attempt. Also, I was hoping he*ll eliminate the regressive stance of Himmatwala*s mom after she refuses to defend her daughter, subjected to domestic violence by her slimy husband (Adhyayan Suman is perfectly cast as the new age Shakti Kapoor) offering the same old infuriating *doli-arthi* excuse. The extent of this double standard is when Himmatwala crosses all limits of outrageous with its *Aaj ek maa ek bete ke pair chooyegi* baloney.  In one of the films* hilariously tragic scenes, a character says, *Teri maa, meri maa. Teri bahen, meri bahen.* But even though I sincerely tried Sajid, teri audience cannot be meri audience.*</Review>

Why remake Himmatwala, which wasn't exactly scintillating cinema in the first place? What were the studios, producers, directors and stars thinking? And last, but not, as they say, the least, when, oh when will Bollywood's blind love affair with the 80s masala movies get over? The Himmatwala of 1983, itself a remake of a Telugu blockbuster, was a comic actioner typical of its era. Villages with their 'bechara gaonwalas' and evil thakurs were leaving Bollywood's landscape, but slowly. So Jeetendra and Sridevi did jhatkas on beaches filled with techni-coloured matkas. One classic scene had the nicely- filled out Sri in a one-piece swimming costume squealing loudly in a pond with her sahelis. In other places, Sridevi wore tight 'pedal-pushers' (remember those?). And Jeetu in his high-waisted trousers and white shoes matched steps with Sri, and rescued his 'dukhiyari' 'ma' and long-suffering 'behen' and the put-upon villagers from their sad fate. The new Himmatwala, with practically the same plot, and a lot of the same lines and situations, gives us Ajay Devgn and Tamannah as the brave Ravi and his lady love Rekha, Mahesh Manjrekar as the cruel 'sarpanch' and Paresh Rawal as his sidekick ( those with long memories will remember Amjad Khan and Kadar Khan in these roles). Instead of Waheeda Rehman, we get Zarina Wahab as the sobbing mother. And a film that is hard to sit through, not because it is all actively ghastly, but because it is so deathly listless. When I was not cringing, I was dozing. Just like in the older movie, this one begins with Ravi ( Devgn) returning to his village after a long absence to find his mother ( Wahab) and sister in a sorry state. Even those who haven't seen the original, will know how this will pan out : the hero, who is called 'himmatwala' by himself and by others every two minutes lest we forget, will bash up the baddies and sort things out. He will go up bare-handed against twenty men and fight a tiger, and roar and snarl when he is not prancing and clowning. Devgn is all right when he dead pans, but shaking a leg is still not his thing. And seriously, a song that uses little kids to kick people on the butt? Or, 'bum pe laat' as it so delicately puts it? And showing a young woman being slapped and whipped and humiliated with great enthusiasm, with the 'doli' and 'arthi' dialogue thrown in? I expected Himmatwala to be predictable, not only because I have faint memories of the older film, but because it follows such a template. I also expected it to be annoying, and it doesn't disappoint on both scores. But I didn't think it would be so dull. There's a spot when Devgn, blood dripping from his hand, tells his leading lady: 'yeh 1983 hai yaar, dupatta phaado aur baandh do'. We smile at this line. Because it is a smart send-up of the films we used to love despite themselves. If this Himmatwala had adopted that tone and kept it flowing through the film, it would have been something to watch. Devgn manages to get it in a couple of moments, but only in a couple.</Review>

Note how the posters describe Himmatwala as A Sajid Khan Entertainer. Nowhere do they specify it is a 'film'. Entertainment, unlike film, is a variable asset, Sajid would perhaps argue. One person's entertainment can be another's headache. A review of Himmatwala is redundant. If you hate Sajid's brand of entertainment you won't waste time over analysis, chances are you won't read the review anyway. If you love this kind of bawdy circus you don't care what a review says, chances are you don't read reviews anyway. Sajid directs bad films that make good money. His cinema so far has revealed no ambition at improving or reimagining mainstream rules. Quite apt that his latest should be a remake of a potboiler hit of the eighties, a decade most regard as creatively the worst for Hindi cinema. Himmatwala 2013 retains every bit of the tacky swagger that worked 30 years ago, raising a pertinent question. If this remake turns out to be a hit as Sajid has pompously predicted, has Hindi commercial cinema really not moved anywhere in three decades? To refresh the 'story', Ajay plays Ravi, son of a poor woman (Zarina Wahab) who raises the boy to avenge the wrongs on their family. There is the evil landlord (Mahesh Manjrekar) behind the brutality, to justify the hero's action quota. And there is the landlord's spoilt daughter (Tamanaah), to justify his naach-gaana and crude comic bursts. The 1983 film starring Jeetendra and Sridevi owed inspiration to a Telugu hit called Ooriki Monagadu. Jeetendra, termed Jumping Jack those days for his bouncy dancing style, balanced the pelvic thrusts with heavy-duty melodrama, action and lewd humour to become a top star. He made a career after that working in Tamil and Telugu remakes through the eighties. You find a parallel in Ajay Devgn. He is around the same age now and owes much of his recent success to southern remakes such as Singham and Son Of Sardaar. At 43 and flaunting a heroine exactly 20 years younger, Ajay is gunning for another hit with Himmatwala. The hype may help this film make profits, but it will not pitch him into the Khan league. It is almost embarrassing watching Ajay ape Jeetendra's moves. Dance, Sajid should have kept in mind, is not among Ajay Devgn's strongest areas and he cuts an inadvertently funny picture trying to shake a leg Jeetu ishtyle. He looks ridiculous trying to act cool too, while eve teasing the heroine. As expected, Ajay goes great guns with the action (though the highlight fight with the tiger could look straight out of Cartoon Network). He is in form with the high-voltage dialogue baazi, too. Ajay's co-star Tamannaah gets little to do beyond playing the shrew who will be tamed after her due quota of bum pe laat, and doing the jiggy in Amrapali costumes. It is pretty much what Sridevi did in the original. Unlike Sridevi though, this remake will not make Tamannaah a superstar. The stray shades of class come from the film's prop cast. Paresh Rawal, in particular, is brilliant as Narayan Das. Honestly, he does better than what Kader Khan did in the original. That, though, is not enough to stop you from chanting 'Tacky o Tacky' as the end credits roll.</Review>

Eighties was the disco era. Point noted. Next is a fight sequence where Ajay Devgn fights a big and beefy Russian guy. There are giant cut outs of Madonna from Lucky girl and Sylvester Stallone from Rocky 2 above the ring. This is the early eighties. Point noted. Sajid Khan spends a lot of time and effort to establish that Himmatwala is based in the *80s. But he doesn't spend enough time recreating any drama, glamour or entertainment that made his source material memorable. Point is Jeetendra and Sridevi*s Himmatwala from 1983 was sinful fun. It was the masala movie that gave pots (in the original Naino mein sapna song) a cult cinematic status. Sajid Khan*s Himmatwala is a big budget parody of the original. Sadly it isn't half as good. Ajay Devgn is the angry and Singham-like interpretation of Ravi, replete with the Ata mazhi satakli punch line. He*s the saviour of a town ruled by Sher Singh. A supposedly menacing landlord who*s most heinous act in the entire film is perhaps that he talks with his mouth full of food. Mahesh Manjrekar as Sher Singh is funny. And of course, a far cry from being a villain. In the muddle (story) are Ravi*s mother Savitri and sister Padma. Their job is to pump melodrama, tears, helplessness and overt family values into the movie. They*re of course the quintessential victims of Sher Singh*s tyranny. The bad man had framed their patriarch of stealing from the local temple. And Ravi*s father had committed suicide because of that. It all makes sense because it*s the *80s. Then there*s Sher Singh*s brother in law Narayan Das whose hair is quite possibly the funniest and most ridiculous prop ever used in the history of Indian cinema. He*s the buffoon with witty one-liners and the movie*s chief comic relief. And finally there*s Tamannaah playing Sher Khan*s daughter Rekha. She goes from hating poor people to loving Ravi and defying her quote unquote evil father faster than the tiger*s sprint. Yes it*s the *80s and a tiger plays an important part in Himmatwala*s narrative. Himmatwala is well-made, well-choreographed and heck even the actors have performed with conviction. But the writing of this movie (if there was any) makes no sense. There*s a parody of the famous murder in the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock*s Psycho. There are two things wrong with it. One * it doesn't make sense why it*s part of a film that is based in rural India of the *80s. Two * it*s not funny. Himmatwala refuses to take itself seriously. A comedy can be more than a series of gags strung together. Films like Andaz Apna Apna had their share of slapstick and madness, but the funny scenes were woven around a story that made sense. Just because it*s the *80s it doesn't mean an entertaining film can forget that it needs to tell a story with some amount of conviction. Nonetheless, in a barrage of over-the-top performances Tamannaah, Ajay Devgn and Paresh Rawal show conviction in their performances. Tamannaah plays a role that catapulted Sridevi into super stardom. Comparisons are unfair but inevitable and Tamannaah does her best to match up to her predecessor. She gives a good performance and excels in the funny scenes. But when it comes to dancing Sridevi wins hands down. Ajay Devgn is the reason Himmatwala gathers sporadic dramatic steam. Even though he can't dance like Jeetendra, Ajay lends tour de force to the action sequences especially the climax. Paresh Rawal as the joker Narayan Das is loonier than Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck put together. His performance is an example of an actor going no-holds-barred. In all honesty, to have any expectations of film craft and writing from a film that refuses to acknowledge that*s it*s a film is unfair. After all this is a Sajid Khan *entertainer*. But sadly, this entertainer doesn't entertain as much as it shoulMovie</Review>

He believes what worked in 1983 will click in 2013 too. Come to think of it, he might actually be right. Sad! Having been at the receiving end of the mindless excesses of the loud and laboured comedies that he specializes in, we know exactly what to expect from his latest foray into the terrain of tastelessness * zilch. And that is such a huge advantage for a filmmaker. If you, in the manner of the director, accept that unalloyed bunkum can be legitimately passed off, and gleefully lapped up, as cinematic entertainment, you might even come away pleased as punch with Himmatwala. The film lacks punch, but it loses no opportunity to pun on the word and the act. The braveheart hero, a big-city streetfighter who returns to his village to settle old scores with an evil headman, uses a powerful punch to tame a tiger (no less!) and a host of other adversaries. To rub it in, the villain*s puckish brother-in-law advises the village sarpanch to be wary of a *sar pe punch* from the vengeful prodigal. What unfolds in the course of a hollow and hackneyed two-and-a-half-hour clash between good and evil has neither head nor tail. But Sajid Khan could not care less. He foists a turgid concoction of humour, drama and romance upon the audience without pulling a punch. His male protagonist declares: *Main pehle hasaata hoon phir roolata hoon (I*ll make you laugh before I make you cry)*. So don't complain that you weren't warned! The director strings together several supposedly comic gags to stretch the narrative to snapping point, but often forgets that he also has a story to tell. One would have described the film as pea-brained and left it at that if only if it had a semblance of a brain. Himmatwala is a mindless potpourri that brings together the worst ingredients of 1980s Hindi cinema and parlays them into a messy m?nge that quivers repeatedly under its own weight. Being a Sajid Khan film, it also has its share of item numbers that keep pace with the purposeless gags. In fact, Himmatwala opens with an item number * Sonakshi Sinha sways rather disinterestedly to Thank God, It*s Friday * in a nightclub called Funkytown Disco. And who is the owner of this disco? It*s Chunkey Pandey. He tells us that on the last day of every month, his dance floor turns into a bare-knuckles boxing ring. It*s just the kind of site that the himmatwala needs to announce his grand entry. And who is his opponent tonight? It*s a man called Zebisco. Rhymes with disco, got it? The stage is set and the sluice-gates are thrown open for an abundance of such inanities. If nothing else, what Himmatwala certainly has a profusion of is a complete disregard for logic and narrative finesse. In remaking a revenge drama that barely passed muster as a film but made pots of money, the director has sought to attempt nothing that could tinker with the original*s lowbrow reputation. Make no mistake: the 2013 Himmatwala is as awful as the 1983 Himmatwala. We can only hope against hope that consumers of Hindi cinema of this variety have moved on enough to treat it with the disdain it deserves. Unfortunately for lovers of cinema and happily for the makers of Himmatwala, we have empirical evidence to suggest that the Sajid Khan brand of filmmaking still could be just as crowd-pleasing as it was 30 years ago. Himmatwala is Sajid Khan*s first film without Akshay Kumar. But in Ajay Devgn, he finds an equally willing ally. So banish all illusions of a better deal. This isn't of course an exact copy. The director makes freewheeling changes both in terms of characters and situations. But no amount of tweaking can do much to save this piece of tawdry twaddle from being a complete washout. Himmatwala is painfully overlong, insufferably silly and utterly devoid of any genuine touches of inspiration. The schoolteacher-father of 1983 gives way to a devout temple priest, but the protagonist and the baddie remain essentially unaltered. The wronged mother, the slimy munimji, the latter*s godawaful son, the hero*s lachrymose sister and the villain*s daughter keep popping in and out of the drama as the eponymous hero goes about setting things right in the village. It is still 1983. One character even talks about catching the Jeetendra-Sridevi starrer. When another refers to swine flu, he is told that there is no such disease known to mankind. *It*ll come in 20-30 years,* he quips. The acting borders on the crude for the most part, with both Mahesh Manjrekar (the sarpanch) and Paresh Rawal (the saala) pulling out all the stops. Devgn gives Himmatwala his best shot but stepping into the Jumping Jack*s boots while strutting around in the garb of a bone-crunching terminator can't be easy. He is joined in the garish Taaki taaki and Nainon mein sapna routines by Tamannaah Bhatia. Sans the thunder thighs that made Sridevi such a force, she is no patch on the real thing. Coming back to Sajid Khan, he not only believes in the *anything goes* philosophy that drives a segment of the Mumbai movie industry, he also dares to go out on a limb to try and pull it off in practice. To each his own. But you don't really have to subject yourself to this monstrous assault on the senses, even if you are blessed with loads of himmat.</Review>
      <Review Id="145" Name="Mansha Rastogi" Expected="" Link="http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/10913/bollywood.hindi/himmatwala/4171/review.htm" Affiliation="nowrunning.com" Date="29th March, 2013" Likes="76" Rating="1/5">Read any recent interview of Sajid Khan and you would see him stating "According to critics, I think too much of myself," well Sajid, after watching Himmatwala critics will surely change what they say to "Sajid Khan has stopped thinking altogether." One can never imagine a day would come when you would claim all of Sajid Khan's previous works to be master pieces compared to this apology of a film titled Himmatwala! Re-written as the filmmaker claims this remake to be, Himmatwala of the present times has pretty much the same plot with scenes twisted here and there. A tyrant Sher Singh (Mahesh Manjrekar) who has the entire village under his control uses his might and power to wrongly frame Dharam Murti (Anil Dhawan), the pandit, who catches Sher Singh committing murder. On being shamed in front of the villagers Dharam Murti commits suicide while his wife (Zarina Wahab) is left with two kids to fend of herself. Sher Singh's tyranny doesn't end here as he comes after Dharam Murti's son too. But the mother helps Ravi, the child escape. The son, now Ajay Devgn, returns to Ram Nagar after years to avenge his father's death and his mother's lost pride. Himmatwala, with its inane ludicrousness gives Hindi cinema new lows of creativity. And Sajid Khan doesn't just stop at further violated an already over the top film of the '80s, he also brings about a reference of the famous bathroom scene from the Alfred Hitchcock cult suspense horror Psycho which should be a crime in itself. If the original film wasn't soaked in enough melodrama, Sajid Khan takes melodrama to a whole new level with dialogues that must've been done to death in the '80s alone. So you have a mother wailing, "Tujhe teri maa ki kasam hai beta" or mouthing hackneyed lines like, "Tune meri kok se janam nahi liya, tune mera doodh nahi piya!" Yes, you can gag on those lines while they unabashedly are screened over melodramatic background score that makes you want to wail too at your bad karma of watching the film. If the tripe cinema isn't enough to numb your sense, there's ample buffoonery in the name of humour and character-sketch that works brilliantly to leave you seething. Sure Kader Khan went the slapstick way with his characterization in the original but Sajid Khan's version of Narayandas with Paresh Rawal playing the role is preposterous. It's a pity to see the hugely talented Paresh Rawal ham away to glory courtesy a filmmaker who deems such ridiculousness as humour. Mahesh Manjrekar tries too hard to show some menacing elements of being the bad guy but sadly, he too falls for the tawdry writing of the filmmaker. Asrani who is stuck in the time warp of being the Jailor in Sholay for the nth time essays similar role. Adhyayan Suman playing the role once essayed by Shakti Kapoor is average at best while Zarina Wahab filling in the shoes of Wahida Rehman does justice to her portions. Ajay Devgn, the Himmatwala of the new version tries blending his valour with comedy but fails miserably this time around. There's definitely a limit to extract from a formula and Ajay seems to have reached his. South star Tamannaah Bhatia on the other hand is the only respite in the film. Not only does she look beautiful but also plays her part well.</Review>

Post this film, there was a sea of remakes, with Jeetendra, Sridevi, Kader Khan, Shakti Kapoor and Asrani featuring in almost every remake... It's easy to remake a successful film, but the responsibility that Sajid Khan carries on his shoulders cannot be assessed in mere words. Right from the masala quotient to Ajay and Tamannah matching steps with Jeetendra and Sridevi, respectively, each and every aspect of the new version will be examined with a magnifying glass. While a section of the industry [as well as moviegoers] opine that trendsetting movies should not be touched [read remade], there also exists a section that feels that the present-day generation would love to watch those films in new avtaars. The debate continues... The pertinent query is, does Sajid Khan's HIMMATWALA recreate the magic of K. Raghavendra Rao's HIMMATWALA [1983], which itself was a remake of a Telugu film? At the very outset, let me inform you that the two HIMMATWALAs are almost similar, yet dissimilar. While the basic premise remains identical, besides retaining two hugely popular tracks, Sajid has modified certain portions of the film, besides adding a few episodes. What's common between the two versions is the intent to provide entertainment to its target audience -- those who relish masala fares. Now let's talk of the new HIMMATWALA. It's all about entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. Right from the styling to death-defying action to fiery dialogue delivered in high decibels, everything that you get to see in HIMMATWALA is reminiscent of the Bollywood of the 1980s. The mother-son drama, the hero-villain conflict, the heroism... even Ajay's introductory sequence is straight out of 1980s. Be forewarned, HIMMATWALA is 1980s cinema packaged in a new wrapping, but even if you have an appetite for the masala movies of yore or are ready to do a time travel to the angry young man of 1980s, chances are you will feel suffocated by the on-screen goings-on that Sajid Khan dishes out in the name of entertainment. HIMMATWALA narrates the story of a son [Ajay Devgn], who comes to the village to avenge the injustice meted out to his father [Anil Dhawan], who had been wrongly accused by the Sarpanch [Mahesh Manjrekar] of robbery. HIMMATWALA takes you back to the familiar terrain. It's the typical good versus bad saga loaded with every possible ingredient that makes masala films tick. Sajid ensures that those who have watched the earlier HIMMATWALA -- or those who haven't watched it -- get paisa vasool entertainment in those 2.30 hours, but, unfortunately, what unfolds on screen is so routine and monotonous that you fervently hope for some novelty in this adaptation. One doesn't mind massy entertainers, but there has to be a hook to keep the viewer's attention arrested. HIMMATWALA provides that only towards the closing stages of the film, when the mother [Zarina Wahab] gets to know of Ajay's true identity. Sajid makes an attempt to pay homage to the cinema of yore, but what he delivers makes you sit motionless for most parts. If a movie fails to invoke wolf whistles or ovation at the right places, you realize something is seriously wrong. The biggest problem is Sajid does nothing, absolutely nothing out of the box or path-breaking in the current scenario to grab your attention, which is why HIMMATWALA fails as a film. The romance lacks fire, the drama is devoid of intensity, even the action is plain ordinary* Frankly, HIMMATWALA has nothing that warrants a repeat viewing. While Sajid retains two hugely popular tracks from the original ['Naino Mein Sapna' and 'Taki Taki'], HIMMATWALA has yet another track that's lilting -- 'Bum Pe Laat'. However, 'Thank God It's Friday', at the very start of the film, is plain ordinary, despite the star presence of Sonakshi Sinha. Sajid-Farhad's dialogue have always been mass-friendly and the lines in HIMMATWALA are a riot at times. The masses will love the dialogue delivered by Paresh Rawal specifically. The action sequences are just about okay. We have seen better stuff in several escapist fares recently. Ajay slips into the retro avatar effortlessly. Generally known for his intense performances, he plays to the gallery well. He may be awkward in dances, but he makes sure he roars like a lion when he confronts the antagonist. Tamannah faces an uphill task of stepping into Sridevi's shoes and though she looks photogenic, there's no acting talent on display here. Mahesh Manjrekar doesn't evoke terror that one would associate with his character. Paresh Rawal is the real scene stealer, who gets to deliver the best lines. Zarina Wahab shines in the penultimate sequence mainly. Adhyayan Suman is wooden. Rajendra Gupta and Vindu Dara Singh have bit roles. Asrani is wasted. The actress enacting the role of Ajay's sister does well. Riteish Deshmukh appears in a cameo. Oh, before I forget, there's a tiger too, who comes across as the real himmatwala in the climax of the film! On the whole, HIMMATWALA fails as a film. The only silver lining is the presence of A-list stars and of course, the hype surrounding the film, which might attract footfalls in mass-friendly circuits initially. But as a film that promises big entertainment, HIMMATWALA is hugely disappointing!</Review>

Prakash Jha is one of the few directors in Bollywood who has consistently championed political cinema. His rage at the rotten state of the system has simmered through his movies for nearly three decades. But from the National Award-winning Damul in 1984 to Satyagraha, his stories have become increasingly simplistic, star-driven and heavy-handed. Satyagraha takes its inspiration from Anna Hazare�s historic fast, which brought the central government to its knees in 2011. Amitabh Bachchan is Daduji, an upright retired school teacher, who revolts against the corrupt government with a fast unto death. Ajay Devgn, the Arvind Kejriwal figure, is Manav, his right-hand man. Manav starts out as a successful businessman � he is described as the rising star of the communication sector and early in the film Daduji mockingly calls him �the ultimate consumer� � but Manav soon gives up his materialistic ways to follow Daduji. Kareena Kapoor Khan is the idealistic reporter Yasmin. Manoj Bajpayee, Jha�s go-to villain, is the slimy politician who stands in their way. Jha and his co-writer Anjum Rajabali, borrow liberally from headlines. They give us Machiavellian ministers, deal-making opposition leaders, scams, self-immolating protestors. The film tries to say so much that it ends up saying very little. Which is a shame because Satyagraha has flashes of power � in a nicely done scene, an enraged Daduji slaps the corrupt collector. Jha pushes our patriotic buttons with a remix of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram. He also gives us a peek into the politics of Satyagraha and how even the good guys take wrong calls. Though Bachchan and Bajpayee have played the upright patriarch and heinous politician for Jha before, both give striking performances. But the impact is diluted by a plot that lurches from one event to the next without giving us anything new. Characters speak tired lines like Mamla serious ho raha hai and System sadh gaya hai. And one of the main slogans is: Janta Rocks.  Sadly, this call to our conscience doesn�t.</Review>

It becomes a case of putting on celluloid events that have just finished unfolding, and are still unravelling in front of our eyes: if it is happening in real life, why do we need a reel version? Especially a version which doesn't add anything of significance to the narrative: it's all been-here-seen-this-and-that before. Mahatma Gandhi may have been the original satyagrahi, but two years ago, there was Anna Hazare, the man who threatened an indefinite fast unless the government agreed to his demands to enact a law against corruption. The image of Anna is still so strongly etched that even when Amitabh Bachchan channels the Mahatma (a classic scene has Bachchan drape his arms around two young girls and walk, in almost the same pose as the Mahatma did, all those decades ago), we instantly think of the man who colonised Jantar Mantar. And when we see Ajay Devgn, who plays Amitabh Bachchan's trusty lieutenant, we think of Arvind Kejriwal, the man who has broken away and formed his party against corruption, and which is readying to fight the elections in 2014. There are other characters which Satyagraha borrows from real life: the image of a student setting himself afire is taken from the 1991 Mandal agitation; the too- tiny thread of an honest officer (a direct reference to the slain NHAI project director Satyendra Dubey) being bumped off when he becomes an embarrassment for the local administration is much more recent, but had an equally strong impact. In a fictional North Indian town, there lives an engineer (Indraneil Sengupta, in a criminally brief role ) who wants to build roads and highways and do his bit for Bharat Nirmaan, and jumps in where angels fear to tread. We all know what happens to conscientious whistleblowers. That leaves his grieving Babuji Dwarka Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) and his anguished wife Sumitra (Amrita Rao) fighting the corrupt system as personified by corrupt neta Balram Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) and his cohorts, with the help of corporate shark-who-is-about-to-have-a-change-of-heart Manav (Ajay Devgn), local wannabe youth-leader-with-a-good-heart Arjun (Arjun Rampal), and feisty TV journalist Yasmin (Kareena Kapoor Khan). The film would have become interesting if the story had allowed for some nuance. If, for example, Amitabh's upright, moralistic Babuji had been shown to have some flaws, or Manoj Bajpayee's evil politician who is the chief villain, had been a little humanised, or if Sengupta's honest technocrat had been given a little more to do, Satyagraha would have had more heft. But then that would have made the fight between good versus evil a little complicated, and who wants complications in a film that serves up uni-dimensional characters who are barely disguised versions of real-life personalities in a story that embraces the simplistic with fervour? The film progresses with sequences of the sort we've seen before in Jha's own films. The fact that the actors are also the same (Amitabh Bachchan played a near-similar character in Aarakhshan, while Ajay Devgn, Arjun Rampal and Manoj Bajpayee are almost like a Jha repertory) adds to the similar feel. In order to make the film 'youth-friendly', the bhajan Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram becomes a ditty. The characters are ciphers flitting in and out: Rampal roams around in a jeep, with slogan-shouting companions; Bajpayee is nicely oily but we've seen him in this guise before, and Kapoor Khan's character, with artfully mussed hair and thick kajal, which journalists presumably sport, is most puzzling: is she an objective recorder of events for her TV channel, or a part of the crusade against corruption? She keeps criss-crossing the lines, depending on what the scene wants her to do. Devgn's part could have gone somewhere. As the guy of today who wants to use technology-driven social media � Facebook updates and Twitter posts fly thick and fast � to bring about change, but who is a pragmatist, even befriending the bad guys as a means to an end, Manav could have been a well-rounded character. But, after a few sketchy flourishes, he also reverts to type. And the end is chaos, very far from the non-violent satyagrah that the film propounds: gun-toting hooligans and cops run around the town, ending predictably in noble deaths and lectures on morality and goodness.</Review>

China, currency, corruption, choose your alphabet. And then there is cinema. Recession-proof they call it, the entertainment industry. It explains phenomena like Chennai Express. Escapist, yes but for how long can films serve as short-term drugs? At some point, cinema itself must serve as a mirror (as it has always done) and reflect the collective mood of a people. Prakash Jha came a full circle with his brand of cinema with Gangaajal in 2003, returning to what put him on the map in the first place with Damul (1985). He gave himself a mandate - activism through mainstream cinema - and embarked on a series of films on remarkably diverse subjects ranging from the Bhagalpur Blindings case to the state of education in the country, from an assessment of Indian dynastical politics to the Naxal quandary; always subtly offering to weigh in on a position that may not be the prevalent opinion. But Jha's films try too hard to sell themselves in this escapist market. Whether it's the item song or the melodrama - in the last decade his style has been too consistent, and hence predictable - there's reluctance to evolve. Sure, these entertainers-meets-socially relevant films gives him the luxury of casting some of the biggest stars in town (even if it means they're reduced to merely hanging around, inelegantly squeezed into wide frames as Arjun Rampal and Amrita Rao are in Satyagraha), and align with big studios for release; but there is little growth in the presentation. Unfortunately, there are no surprises left. The trailer tells a story centered on corruption and Anna Hazare'a andolan. And that's what you get. Because the truth is that every Prakash Jha film is beginning to look like a clone of the other. It's becoming an annual experience, a socio-political introductory class for the masses featuring skivving, scheming, and Skyping politicians, hordes of media people armed with ancient video cameras, mechanical mega crowds, clumsy depiction of social media, and self-righteous protagonists often thrust into a regrettable romance sans chemistry. The posters of these films often make their way as backdrops in the films themselves. The parallels between Aarakshan and Satyagraha alone are worth mentioning. The affluent upstart trades his wealth for the cause (Prateik earlier, now Devgn, both unconvincing), the modern day MK Gandhi in Bachchan who literally continues from where is left off earlier, and of course the villain's graph, reduced to clowning in the end. It's not that Jha doesn't have his moments of utter brilliance. Manoj Bajpai's character - the home minister of a central Indian state - is, unsurprisingly, the most nuanced, most honestly written, and most accurately depicted in the ensemble. All our lives, he says, a politician works to earn his five years in office. Isn't it his right to reap the riches when he finally gets there? The rest are far too idealistic at the other end to be taken seriously. A self-righteous corporate magnate who gives up 6000+ crores? Pfft. And then there is the Hazare-inspiration. Why does it feel that Jha wants us to equate Amitabh Bachchan's character with Mohandas Gandhi and not Hazare in an attempt to idealize what should've been. If it's not entirely clear early on, the matter is put to rest after a barrage of indications (a prominent chowk, the Raghupati Raghav rock song, Gandhi's aphorisms in dialogue) comes hurtling with a final tell when a weak, fasting Bachchan takes the support of two young ladies to walk up to address a gathering of children. Satyagraha tackles corruption at a basic and national level. Unlike his other films, Jha merely highlights the issue here garnishing it with brief emotional moments that work. But this time, his target audience is aware. Even with Chakravyuh, you could argue the film informed the unenlightened citizen. Satyagraha solely documents and offers fleeting wisdom. It succeeds at highlighting the problem but fails at achieving poignancy.</Review>

Systemic rot makes small things in our lives difficult and dreary. Director Prakash Jha and Anjum Rajabali, his co-writer in Satyagaraha, prop their film on that very saleable idea. Obviously inspired by the mutinous Anna Hazare wave that gripped the country last year, they write a high-pitched, anti-establishment drama. Mob hysteria is black and white, and in a film, it can go terribly wrong unless real characters behind the hysteria are delineated with imagination. There are no real characters in Satyagraha, only simplistic, representative figures drumming up relentless noise. Set in a fictional town, Amitabh Bachchan plays the lead of Dadu, a former school teacher and a Gandhian, who loses his son in an accident. Predictably, he is against commerce and alcohol. An impulsive action puts him in jail and the son�s friend Manav (Ajay Devgn) engineers a movement to free him using social media and a TV journalist Yasmin (Kareena Kapoor). A national revolution ensues. A local politician (Arjun Rampal), supposedly an outlaw, who has his tricks of working around the system, joins in without any persuasion. The scheming politician they are directly up against has the familiar neta attributes, played effectively by Manoj Bajpai. Amitabh Bachchan plays a Gandhian in the film In more than 150 minutes of its running time, same scenes and situation repeat, just for the sake of rousing the tempo, leading up to an unbelievably facile climax. Add to this noise, songs with lyrics like �janta rocks, janta talks� set to very ordinary beats, and Satyagraha becomes a travesty. Jha is more a pamphleteer rather than a director here. Besides the blinkered view on the politics of the common man, he is surprisingly blind to some film-making basics. Lighting by cinematographer Sachin Krishn could suit a TV soap opera. Editing is slack. The production design of this film is so poor, that even if there are some weighty scenes and some snatches of moving performances, you are unlikely to notice them. Devgn ropes in Kapoor to help engineer a movement to free Bachchan Bachchan�s restrained histrionics, his looming presence and the baritone lend some restorative gravitas to the underdeveloped character he plays. Devgn�s Manav gets equal importance in the story, but again, it is a character with a linear tone and graph, and Devgn does not add extra weight to it�depending on one or two expressions throughout the film. Kapoor as the journalist who joins the fold of the activists, Rampal as the politician who conforms much too easily and Amrita Rao as Dadu�s daughter-in-law are bland and uninspired. The story demands nothing out of this star cast. Bajpai�s crook politician has some clever lines and he plays the role with enough zest. Satyagraha is a missed opportunity. By translating a phenomenon that captured the national imagination even fleetingly, it could have humanized the Anna brigade. Jha dumbs down, and does it artlessly.</Review>

Aarakshan messed it up midway. Chakravyuh looked like Prakash Jha was not even sure of what he was doing. The writer-director's fetish for cocktailing topical realism and box-office friendly masala continues with Satyagraha. A comparative analysis of Jha's recent oeuvre becomes essential because in look and rendition Satyagraha reminds you of every film the director has made Raajneeti onwards. If the Prakash Jha film in itself has become a formula, his latest does not break the pattern. The film is well-intentioned film, its message relevant. Unfortunately, not every well-intentioned film with relevant message leaves an impact. Satyagraha is more Aarakshan than Raajneeti in quality. Jha's latest leaves an impression mainly because his issue at hand has pressed us all more than anything else in recent times. The film addresses corruption in governance and makes the case for a public uprising to thwart the malady. He may have denied it but any resemblance Jha's film bears to the Anna Hazare movement is far from coincidental. Sure, Amitabh Bachchan's satyagrahi Dwarka Anand bears no physical traits similar to Kisan Baburao Hazare. In reference (if Hazare is called Anna, Dwarka is referred to as Daduji) and its Gandhian spirit, the mould is the same. Like Anna's activism too, Dwarka takes to hunger strike to inspire the masses. The idea must have seemed a sureshot winner when the film was launched. In 2013, when Anna fever has somewhat waned, Satyagraha struggles to generate drama using that real-life reference. You realise the film's drawback taking as much into account. Despite its pertinent influence from reality, the drama loses grip with each passing minute. The script (Jha and Anjum Rajabali) imagines Ajay Devgn as Manav Raghavendra, ambitious telecom tycoon who lives to mint money. That Manav's ideology does not bode well with his best friend Akhilesh's father, retired school principal Dwarka Anand, is established early on. After Akhilesh dies in what seems like a road accident, Manav is gradually exposed to the level of corruption inherent in the government machinery. A chain of incidents will lead to Dwarka launching a hunger strike movement against forces that threaten democracy.The wide mix of characters thrown in are too obviously either white or black, no grey shades in Jha's world of realism. Kareena Kapoor Khan's TV journalist or Arjun Rampal's local goon/politician with a heart of gold cry out from their first scene that they are to be counted as the good guys. Just as it doesn't take you a moment to figure out Manoj Bajpayee's wily home minister will provide the film its evil edge for the rest of its runtime. For a film so dedicated to its message, such flat characterisation is baffling. Still, Ajay Devgn makes an impressive Manav. His morphing from a corpo high-flyer to the man who learns to see the pain on the streets is gradual and authentic. Kareena would seem a tad too glamorous for a hard-boiled TV reporter, her make-up and wardrobe curiously never missing the style index no matter what situation she is in. Her love story with Manav looks forced into the screenplay. Finally, Big B. It is a performance that virtually dominates every twist of mood in the narrative. After two and half hours of a performance finely-nuanced, Jha gives an unbelievably filmy end to Dwarka's fate. If you still find yourself marvelling at the man's screen presence, that's Amitabh Bachchan for you.</Review>

You know it's a Prakash Jha film when you see all the biggies of B-Town coming together to give the best performances of their lives and you know it's a Prakash Jha film when there are too many sermons to preach. But any overkill in any of the above can throw you into the pits of boredom. Jha's latest release Satyagraha gets mired by such an overkill. We tell you know how. Satyagraha reflects the uprising of middle class against a corrupt and unjust system. It is the story of a dynamic and ambitious young man who is poised for corporate success when a personal tragedy exposes him to the shocking consequences of corruption in this country. It's the story of a man who is a firm believer of Gandhian principles (Amitabh Bachchan), an ambitious entrepreneur who represents the modern India shining philosophy (Ajay Devgn), a social activist who aims to be a politician (Arjun Rampal), a fearless political journalist (Kareena Kapoor Khan) and a wily politician (Manoj Bajpayee) who uses every means to break the system. For long Jha has been incessantly claiming that his film doesn't reflect the Anna Hazare movement, neither does it showcase the relationship between Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal however, one wonders while watching the film what harm could it have been had the film just taken inspiration from the real life incident after all. It would've just given the relatable edge. The film, purely going by its story, appears nothing but a rehash of Jha's treatment of the yore, except despite claiming it to be Raajneeti sequel, it doesnt doesn't provide any edge of your seat moment. There's nothing unseen or novel in his story-telling this time around and hence despite addressing the plaguing issues of scams, corruption and lawlessness, the film fails to bear any impact. The dramatisation of the events rob Satyagraha of the realistic appeal that Jha's films inherently possessed in the past owing to which neither does the situation hit you nor does it give you any message. Moreover, during the course of two and a half hours, the film ends up appearing way too preachy for your taste. But to give credit where it's due, Prakash Jha has a unique knack of putting together a pitch perfect ensemble cast. Needless to say, the iconic superstar Amitabh Bachchan excels as the brooding but determined father. However, it's getting tedious to watch him repeat such roles over and over again. Mr. B, it's time to change gears! Both Ajay Devgn and Kareena Kapoor Khan tirelessly try to make the contrived plots seem believable but you can easily spot the chinks in the armour. While Ajay Devgn appears slightly incongrous as the young, out of college entrepreneur, Kareena's scribe act is far from real. There's hardly anything to add to Arjun Rampal's performance. Like in every Manoj Bajpayee-Prakash Jha film, in Satyagraha too it is Bajpayee who outshines everyone and emerges as the star. You'll take an instant disliking to his devious ways which is highly commendable. His effort of infusing laughter to his menacing character is laudable. To sum it up, Satyagraha is nothing but a superficial and half-baked attempt at putting forth a volatile socio-political issue. Watch it only for the performances.</Review>

Vibrantly layered, Satyagraha weaves together urban legends of corruption, encompassing corporate lobbyists to murdered engineers. It features slices of histories, Chauri Chaura, Mandal, Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal Andolan. It takes a real issue - corruption - to reel life, movingly fusing fact with fiction, leading to a security guard accompanying a politico at its screening to sing out aloud, "Aam aadmi kitna aam, Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram..." Retired teacher Dwarka Anand (Bachchan) is an idealistic man. His engineer son Akhilesh's buddy Manav (Devgn) is an ambitious capitalist. Manav cherishes his friend - who suddenly dies. Minister Balram Singh (Bajpai) announces compensation which Akhilesh's wife Sumitra (Rao) cannot get despite daily applications before government babus. Incensed, Dwarka slaps an arrogant official and gets imprisoned. Manav starts a campaign to free him, using social media, roping in wannabe-bahubali Arjun Singh (Rampal) and journalist Yasmin (Kapoor). As hopeful students, hungry labourers and angry middle class citizens join, politicians panic. Will their moves derail the movement? Devgn is Satyagraha's strong body while Amitabh - gaunt in grief, moving in fortitude - is its soul. And Bajpai is its glittering, malevolent cloak, delivering a satiny performance hair-raising in its perfection. Bachchan voices the movie's philosophy - "Janta sarkaar ki malik hai. Malik nirdesh deta hai. Maang nahin karta." But what is the best way to give such nirdesh? Symbolic protest? Violent revolt? Or a longer, harder route? Satyagraha grapples with this dilemma. More philosophical than fiery, it adorns reality with gloss and loss. Dwarka touching the earth where his son fell brings tears while Prasoon Joshi's wonderful lyrics - "Uthkar karne hain kuch kaam, Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram" - bring hope. Satyagraha deserves an extra half-star for capturing corruption from root to branch - a government babu complains, "Yahan toh table ka bhi bhaada dena padta hai". Showing true Satyagraha has no short-cuts, it also shows solutions glimmering ahead, as ephemeral, yet powerful as a rainbow cleansing the dust. Note: You may not like this movie if you avoid socio-political realities in cinema.</Review>
      <Review Id="154" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/satyagraha-movie-review-863" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="29th August, 2013" Likes="2000" Rating="2.5/5">Prakash Jha�s Satyagraha is a political film that, for all its well-meaning bluster, neither stings nor scalds. It fails to hit the core of the truth that it seeks. The Apaharan-Raajneeti-Aarakshan formula is intact here. Director and writer Jha takes up a topical socio-political issue and forges a drama designed to deliver a message of import. Unfortunately, Satyagraha barely skims the surface of a complex theme, leaving many a crucial question unanswered. As a result, it can hardly be expected to shake a vast nation and its somnolent rulers out of their torpor. Satyagraha spares no effort to reflect the rising tide of public anger against a creaking, corrupt and callous system that treats citizens of the country like a load of dirt. The script draws inspiration from several real-life scams and political shenanigans, and constructs a predictable narrative that underlines the undeniable might of social media. The 2G scam, mining policy flip-flops, the ills of coalition politics, underhand deals between fixers and ministers, and the growing role of Twitter and Facebook in driving the popular ire against corruption and poor governance are all alluded to. All this is socially relevant all right, but strictly from the point of view of the plot, it amounts to a bit of overkill. The film raises all the right issues, but it tends to not only too many loose cards on the table but also to employ the wrong tools to get its point across. The righteous indignation that Satyagraha articulates never quite assumes the shape of a full-fledged conflagration that can sock the audience in the face. On the soundtrack, we often hear �Ambikapur is burning�. We see that reality only in the form of slogan-shouting protestors, sermonizing activists haranguing an unresponsive administration and an aimless bunch of patrolling policemen. The fire that is supposed to be raging in the fictional upcountry district that the film is set in does not exactly leap into the sky and turn into genuine, palpable ire. A spirited fightback by an upright and idealistic retired school principal Dwarka Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) and the transformation of a telecom czar Manav Raghavendra (Ajay Devgn) into an aggressive people�s leader constitute the two principal strands of the Satyagraha narrative. Neither develops into a full-bodied battle of attrition that can hold a two-and-a-half-hour film together. A problem that has beset Jha�s recent films is back to haunt Satyagraha as well. The principal characters do not converse like you and me. They make speeches from a rostrum. When they are not letting out hot air from a pedestal, they deliver grand statements of intent to each other and everyone within earshot. It is an approach that is better suited to street theatre than to the big screen. This is not to say that Satyagraha is an unduly strident film that raves and rants about how wrong things are with Indian democracy. In fact, Jha shows flashes of characteristic brilliance in the manner that he handles the film�s quieter moments. A couple of scenes stand out. A shocked-into-silence Dwarka Anand is dignity personified as he demonstrates his grief at the accidental death of his engineer-son (Indraneil Sengupta). Amitabh Bachchan, who is as much in control here as he has ever been, packs more emotion into that single moment of tragic stillness than he is allowed to do in the reams of dialogue that he delivers. In another sequence, driven journo Yasmin Ahmed (Kareena Kapoor) confronts the briefly discredited Manav Raghavendra when he returns from the cold to reclaim his place in the Ambikapur sun. Words, both angry and contrite, are exchanged, but it is the conciliatory kiss that seals it for the twosome. This is deft minimalism. Sadly, such moments are rather rare in Satyagraha. As the speeches roll, angry slogans rent the air and Facebook updates and tweets flash across the screen as a device meant to capture the disgruntlement of the people, the characterizations sinks into shallow generalisations. The chief antagonist, Ambikapur MLA and state home minister Balram Singh (Manoj Bajpayee), is projected as a standard Bollywood villain who smirks and scowls while strutting around the place with the air of a man who knows no stops. The film�s pivotal character, Dwarka Anand, too, never acquires a tangible, believable feel. He is a larger-than-life Gandhi-like figure who abhors greed and violence with equal vehemence. Dwarka Anand, Daduji to his followers, slaps the district collector for not doing his job, gets promptly thrown behind bars, and sparks an agitation that sends the politicians and policemen of Ambikapur scurrying for cover. The ageing teacher�s Anna Hazare-style fast-unto-death, undertaken on a raised platform and under a shamiana in what is called the Ram Leela Maidan, is a laboured plot twist that becomes a lame pretext for another round of speechifying. Satyagraha has a clutch of fine performances with Bachchan, not surprisingly, leading the way with a measured interpretation of a character that sparks a revolt that threatens to spiral out of his grasp. It might be a touch difficult to accept Ajay Devgn as a fresh-out-of-college wannabe entrepreneur. Neither does Kareena Kapoor Khan�s scribe look the part of a television reporter caught in the swirling heat and dust of a small-town revolution. But neither Ajay nor Kareena lets the gaps in logic throw them off balance. Manoj Bajpayee, despite being saddled with a poorly etched part, is the real star of the show. He evokes mirth and provokes loathing with minimum of apparent effort. Parts of Satyagraha make perfect sense but, on the whole, it never comes close to clicking into top gear. It leaves you more disappointed than angry.</Review>
      <Review Id="155" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/566675" Affiliation="bollywoodhungama.com" Date="" Likes="1100" Rating="4/5">Not a day passes when you don't hear/read about rampant scams and corruption, dreadful and appalling crimes, shortage of essential commodities and thick-skinned and power-hungry netas going back on their promises. There's no denying that you commence the day by reading/watching mostly miserable news in newspapers/news channels. Prakash Jha, a conscientious film-maker, has always emphasized on narrating stories that mirror actuality, raising pertinent issues that affect the nation. This time, in SATYAGRAHA, the proficient storyteller attempts to depict the anguish in middle class Indians and how this stratum of society is left with no choice but go on recourse to start a movement against corruption and the deceitful babus responsible for the mess. The timing couldn't be more appropriate, for SATYAGRAHA summarizes the mood of the ordinary man and the nation in general. Jha minces no words while flaying and condemning the fraudulent and unscrupulous politicians and the unjust system in a style that's now synonymous with his brand of cinema -- realistic, hard-hitting, forceful -- that leaves a hammer-strong impact. I wish to affirm that SATYAGRAHA has a striking semblance to Jha's former proficient work RAAJNEETI, but I must also acknowledge that this is Jha's most intensely political film thus far. Right from the abuse of power taking place around us to depicting the ugly underbelly of Indian politics, which, of late, has transformed into big bucks and business, Jha and co-writer Anjum Rajabali make sure they chisel and sculpt the screenplay around the present-day scenario, often borrowing from headlines and episodes that the spectator is acquainted with. In addition, like the well-intended political protest movement sometime back, SATYAGRAHA also portrays the fact that the movement/s ought to be well thought-out and structured to recover from the current scenario. SATYAGRAHA deals with the movement of the middle class to re-negotiate transparency in democracy. It's the story of a man who is a firm believer of Gandhian principles [Amitabh Bachchan], an ambitious entrepreneur who represents the modern India shining philosophy [Ajay Devgn], a social activist who aims to be a politician [Arjun Rampal], a fearless political journalist [Kareena Kapoor Khan] and a wily politician [Manoj Bajpayee] who uses every means to break the system. Prakash Jha, one of the finest narrators of political themes, derives inspiration from a number of real-life episodes that occurred in the recent past, but SATYAGRAHA doesn't take sides nor does it favor/denounce any particular politician. In that respect, it's a standalone film that encompasses episodes such as the Anna Hazare movement, the murder of the whistleblower who exposed the road mafia and the telecom scam, besides highlighting the police attack on public and the candle light protests. Also smartly intertwined are intricate relationships amidst the backdrop of politics and corruption to make the goings-on more absorbing and engaging. Executing a political thriller seems like a cakewalk for Jha, who, by now, is a veteran in this genre of cinema and executes a variety of sequences with aplomb. Note the point in the narrative when Amitabh is released from police custody after Manoj Bajpayee intervenes and the sequence that ensues. There's another pertinent moment between Amitabh and Ajay -- an emotional one, in fact -- which gets you all moist eyed. Similarly, there are several episodes in the second hour that keep you thoroughly hooked to the proceedings... and that includes the culmination, which takes the film to its pinnacle. Besides, Jha smartly bundles in a couple of songs in the narrative, with 'Raske Bhare Tore Naina' [Aadesh Shrivastava] and 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' [Salim-Sulaiman] pepping up the goings-on, especially the latter which has truly strong words that reverberates one's thoughts. Sachin Krishn's cinematography captures the hues and angst with precision. Dialogue are piercing, intense and thought-provoking all through. SATYAGRAHA is embellished with qualitative performances, with each actor grabbing eyeballs. Both Amitabh Bachchan and Ajay Devgn's characters bear striking correlation to real-life characters, but the capable actors ensure they don't come across as caricatures. Amitabh is incomparable and unmatched yet again, delivering a performance that's easily one amongst his finest in the recent times. He's fantastic and also the scene stealer. Ajay underplays his part brilliantly. He breathes fire where required and handles the poignant moments with extreme care, without going overboard. Kareena is effortless yet again, displaying a natural streak while interpreting her character. Arjun Rampal also stands out in a film that boasts of towering performers. That speaks volumes of his range as an actor of calibre and competence. Manoj Bajpayee is vicious and sadistic to the core, flaunting the evil streak to the optimum. Here's another power-packed performance by this splendid actor. Amrita Rao sparkles in a noteworthy role, leaving a strong impression. Indraneil Sengupta leaves a mark in a cameo. Vipin Sharma is tremendous yet again. Vinay Apte is top notch. Mugdha Godse doesn't get much scope. Manoj Kolhatkar, Shireesh Sharma, Ajay Trehan and Girish Sahdev are noticeable. On the whole, SATYAGRAHA is an all-engrossing, compelling drama that mirrors the reality around us. In fact, it's yet another brilliant addition to Prakash Jha's credible repertoire, who has created some of the most politically momentous motion pictures. For the splendid drama and the electrifying dramatic highs, I suggest you must watch this hard-hitting fare. Absolutely recommended!</Review>

And when a Bollywood film gives me a high, I feel like screaming from the rooftops. I loved Shuddh Desi Romance and I think you will too. This film is a triumph for its director Maneesh Sharma, its actors Parineeti Chopra, Sushant Singh Rajput, Vaani Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, but most of all for its writer Jaideep Sahni, who has done the story, screenplay, dialogue and lyrics. Jaideep gives us a love story that is at once utterly believable and utterly romantic; characters that we fall in love with from the first frame and dialogue that makes us smile even when situation is distinctly unfunny � like a groom abandoning his bride at the mandap. There�s a lot of running away in this film. Shuddh Desi Romance is the very circuitous triangle between Gayatri, played by Parineeti, Raghu played by Sushant and Tara, played by Vaani. The first two are commitment-phobic lovers in the throes of a grand passion. Tara is the third leg but she�s no wilting wallflower either. She�s feisty, in control and goes after what she wants. The women in Shuddh Desi Romance are refreshingly strong but not strident. And in between is the irresistibly goofy Raghu, who is easily the most charming guide in Hindi movies since Dev Anand�s Raju in Guide. Maneesh and Jaideep capture a slice of urban India that is stuck somewhere between modernity and tradition but the film works because it has a lightness of being. There is no sermonising here, just confusion, heartache and the inherent comedy of a society caught between the labels of love, lust, marriage, relationships. Sushant and Parineeti capture the nuances perfectly. There isn�t a false note between them and the chemistry is absolutely sizzling � watch their first awkward kiss in a moving bus � it�s equal parts sexy and funny. Debutant Vaani seamlessly fits in � her performance has ease, which is rare for a newcomer. Shuddh Desi Romance loses steam in the second half � it�s almost as if, suddenly, Manish and Jaideep didn�t know where to take their story and characters. Also, I�m old school, so the ending left me dissatisfied. But that doesn�t take away from what has been accomplished here. This film is a dose of adrenalin.</Review>

'Shuddh Desi Romance' takes that conventional wisdom propagated to us in the movies and turns it on its head. What's worth noting is that this movie comes from the stable of Yash Raj Films, the very studio largely responsible for breeding those notions through hits like 'Chandni', 'Dil To Pagal Hai' and 'Bachna Ae Haseeno' among others. Directed by 'Band Baaja Baraat's' Maneesh Sharma and written by 'Chak De India's' Jaideep Sahni, Shuddh Desi Romance is set amidst the bustle of middle-class Jaipur, where unemployed youngsters will happily pose as friends and cousins in a traveling baraat for a few thousand rupees and a gold chain. When he isn't conning white tourists into buying handicrafts from local merchants for a commission, Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput) is busy falling in love. But he goes from sincere to conflicted to selfish in as long as it takes most people to change out of a wedding suit. So he'll woo a girl, win her heart, then develop cold feet at the mandap. This happens thrice in Shuddh Desi Romance, which would be tiring and largely predictable if it weren't for Sahni's crackling dialogue and the charming characters he puts on screen. Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra) is a gregarious rebel Raghu meets on the way to his own wedding. She smokes, she's had boyfriends, and she lets Raghu move in with her when he ditches his shaadi. Tara (newcomer Vaani Kapoor) is the damsel who springs a surprise on both Raghu and the audience. Like most normal couples - hence, unlike the relationships we see in Hindi movies - sexual attraction is the key to our protagonists' equation, and the film doesn't make a big deal about it. In fact, to give credit where it's due, Sahni's script never screams from the rooftops about the brave ideas it pushes so matter-of-factly. Skillfully avoiding melodrama or sloganeering, the film portrays a generation where single women can live in with their boyfriends without being banished by the housing society. This is a refreshingly real middle-class India where marriage needn't be life's sole ambition for young girls, and where women can hold their heads high and carry on with life despite having been ditched at the altar. There's so much to like about Shuddh Desi Romance, including Sharma's nicely textured portrait of the Pink City. The film captures the sights and sounds of a busy metro in ways that most films don't even try. Oblivious that he's ruined someone's appetite, a cook at a jalebi stall scratches his backside with a chhanni. It's little details like these that sparkle with originality. Pity then that the movie runs out of steam in its unconvincing final act, particularly during a confrontation between the two leading ladies that comes off as contrived. In other complaints, the talking-into-camera device is now overused, and seldom works unless what's being said is profound, which isn't always the case here. This in fact, adds to the film's already verbose and occasionally repetitive feel. What cannot be faulted, however, are the terrific performances from the central players. Vaani Kapoor makes an auspicious debut, carrying off Sahni's firecracker lines with the comfort of a pro. Sushant Singh Rajput as Raghu, has an easy charm about him and unmistakable depth behind that scruffy exterior. But it's Parineeti Chopra, reminiscent of a younger Rani Mukherjee, who this film belongs to. She has expressive eyes and an endearing manner about her, and turns Gayatri into the most real woman you've encountered on screen recently. The film also benefits enormously from the casting of an excellent Rishi Kapoor in the part of a feisty wedding caterer and Raghu's father figure. To a large extent, Shuddh Desi Romance reinvents the wheel as far as Bollywood rom-coms go. It's aggressively non-formulaic, and gives us characters who refuse to conform. The minor hiccups notwithstanding, this is a charming little film. I'm going with three-and-a-half out of five. You'll enjoy it.</Review>

Call it nervousness, last-minute jitters or hesitation but the idea of going through an elaborate ceremony witnessed by a huge crowd of people you barely recognise (and is probably finding faults with your make-up) is no one's idea of everlasting bliss and triggers an unexplainable urge to run. Writer Jaideep Sahni offers a perfectly logical explanation for this untimely panic attack, 'Doubt ghadee dekhkar thodina aate hai.' Weddings are largely (and arguably) expensive, public spectacles of a private sentiment, which can be carried out even in its absence. Director Maneesh Sharma explores this space, wearing somewhat rose-tinted glasses, with his new romantic comedy, Shuddh Desi Romance. Live-in relationships are not a novelty at Yash Raj. Films like Deewar (Amitabh Bachchan-Parveen Babi), Salaam Namaste (Saif Ali Khan-Preity Zinta) or Bachna Ae Haseeno (Ranbir Kapoor-Bipasha Basu) marked its presence in varying degree. Only unlike Salaam Namaste, which is set in Australia and concerns itself with the difficulties and compromises of such arrangements, Shuddh Desi Romance unfolds in modern-day Jaipur (shot lavishly by Manu Anand) and maintains a tongue-in-cheek tone from start to finish. Ironically, this is from a banner that's faced criticism for their glossy marriage-obsessed musical packages. With Shuddh Desi Romance, Yash Raj endorses a script that parodies the event if not the institution with Sahni's humorously-penned repartees and a set of perfectly cast actors. The script bears an urban spirit but the earthiness of Sushant Singh Rajput, Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor and their comfort in slipping under Raghu, Gayatri and Tara's skin conceals many of its awkwardness or inadequacies. They're perplexingly similar in so many ways -- easy on ambition, light-weight emotionality and quirky without warning. It makes their interactions both amusing and impersonal. And then comes that fascinating paradox challenging everything. There is a crackling chemistry between Raghu and Gayatri, Raghu and Tara as well as Gayatri and Tara. They're the children of wild, unchecked impulses inhabiting a world where heartbreak doesn't mean end of the world and letting go is easily said, easily done. If the troika represent an aversion for complying to a society-dictated commitment, Rishi Kapoor (resembling a breathing version of those rotund, turban-clad Seth dolls in the souvenir market) who runs a wedding business embodies the mechanical, mindless, money-minded side of celebration. The reliably keen Kapoor highlights the proceedings with his wonderful bouts of exasperation, pragmatic pearls of wisdom while dealing with his own growing insecurity at going out of business. Sharma, who previously directed Band Baaja Baarat and Ladies Versus Ricky Bahl, shows admirable restraint in spelling out the distinction or the generally nonconformist (by Bollywood standards) lifestyle/outlook of his characters in unusual professions. After a dynamic debut in Kai Po Che!, Rajput channelises his abundant energy to convey the childlike ineptitude of a man who wears his heart on a sleeve. A radiant, coral/pearl ring clad Parineeti Chopra owns the scenes she features in by way of her effortless vulnerability and unaffected charm. Their fresh-faced co-star Vaani Kapoor does well for herself in perhaps the most tricky role of the three with her sharp composure and bright, quick-witted smile that is, on occasions, as incisive as Sahni's words. Are romantic sensibilities so dispensable? Are live-in relationships really that simplistic? Shuddh Desi Romance doesn't probe and goes a tad overboard with the mockery towards the end. But it sure points out at the pink elephant in our society. At its 141 minutes running time (editing by Namrata Rao), there's never a dull moment in Sahni's penetrating jibes and whimsical trifling, which strives to convey a simple but underrated philosophy in the most fun way possible -- marry because you want to, not because you must.</Review>

Like, you know, real conversations, where faces are turned to each other, where the baat-cheet between a girl and guy moves from checking-each-other-for-size -banter to will-our-noses-fit-if-we-kiss to can't-keep-our-hands-off-each-other level. Yes, that kind of locked-eyed, quickening breaths, leaping-libidos chat. Writer Jaideep Sahni, the man behind a bunch of excellent films, including one of my all-time favourites, Rocket Singh, lifts Shuddh Desi Romance: his characters talk, and they make us listen. Raghu (Rajput) is a layabout who does this and that, and that includes being a tourist guide in Jaipur, and hiring himself out as a "smart baraati " to raise the tone of marriage parties in exchange for cash. It is in his own baraat that he gets to know spunky, outspoken Gayatri (Chopra), and such are the sparks between them that all ideas of wedded bliss are flung out of the bus window they are travelling in. Which leaves bejeweled bride Tara (Kapoor) stranded at her own mandap. Which in turn, leads to our triangle -- Raghu is scared of shaadis and commitment, Gayatri is equally chary of saying "I Do", and Tara searches for answers, with all three looking for a way forward. These are young people, whose passions and confusions mirror the young of today. The film is set in Jaipur, which allows it to peddle some pretty locations, and leheriya dupattas and safas (it is a Yashraj film, after all), and a song that is all "gulabi" in honour of the Pink City. But itcould be an anywhere story because these are anywhere people. And that's the strength of the film, which comes out best through Parineeti Chopra. She plays her Gayatri minus varnish, minus artifice, without letting any of the effort show, and wins us over : this is an actor getting better with each part. If the other two had been able to match her pitch, Shuddh Desi Romance would have been a very good film indeed. But Rajput (seen previously in Kai Po Che) who has flash and who is able to bring it to the fore, is uneven. He is also the sketchiest of the lot. Kapoor, a first timer, has the looks and confidence, but doesn't lift off the screen as much as her co-stars. And Rishi Kapoor, who plays the avuncular matchmaker put there to mouth "listen-to-your-elders-and-betters" lines, could have done with playing it subtler than he does. Post-interval, there's a discernible dip in energy, and the film gets stretched and contrived. Even the best lines get tired with repetitions, and I caught myself stirring impatiently for the characters to hurry up and get where they are going. Which, when they do, rescues things somewhat: that is a good place, still fairly radical for Bollywood mainstream. It feels right, for this film which stretches the idea of "romaans" in Bollywood, and which comes with one of the loveliest songs I've heard in a while. Tere Mere Beech Mein Kya Hai, it goes, and the lovers talk their way through it. Like you and I would, if we were singing to each other.</Review>

Shuddh Desi Romance, coming in the wake of Raanjhanaa earlier this year, takes the Bollywood love story right into the heartland bylanes, its colourful bazaars, middle-class homes and their toilets (yes, toilets play a wittily imaginative role in the progress of this plot). It is a smalltown backdrop we are all familiar with, and it comes with characters we have definitely met. Maneesh Sharma's latest is more than a feel-good romance though, and the makeover it marks for the mush formula extends beyond a cosmetic change in locale. The film is a fascinating sketch tracking the mindset of today's youth. It talks of a generation that understands love, values commitment but is often found struggling in a domain somewhere in between. Jaideep Sahni's choice to set his script in smalltown Jaipur renders novelty. This is a youth base that faces culture clash more acutely than the big city does. Tradition's collision with a rapidly changing belief system makes for interesting drama. Shuddh Desi Romance wholly draws advantage from the idea. Sahni's writing is known to celebrate stark realism without making it seem too heavy (recall Khosla Ka Ghosla, Chak De! India or Rocket Singh: Salesman Of The Year). It is a quality that gives him a unique place in Bollywood, among writers who are mostly either too spectacular or too sombre. Shuddh Desi Romance only reiterates Sahni's USP. Essentially, this is a rare Hindi film where the writer is as noteworthy as its director, even star cast. Sushant Singh Rajput is cast as Raghu, happy-go-lucky tourist guide in Jaipur and a big reason you will love this film. Raghu meets the feisty Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra) on his way to wed Tara (Vaani Kapoor). Gayatri is a baaraati, and her one-night interaction with Raghu in the baaraat bus gives him the pre-shaadi jitters. He runs away from his marriage. Twist in the tale comes when, after a brief live-in romance, Raghu and Gayatri are set to marry but this time it is she who runs away from the mandap. Raghu, Tara and Gayatri's paths will cross of course, for an interesting finale. Gayatri is as peppy as Parineeti normally gets. You still spot the odd slant at over-the-top acting but by and large Parineeti is a pleasant watch. Newcomer Vaani Kapoor does impressively to match up to her fine co-stars. There is a wild child streak inherent in Tara and Vaani gets the nuances right. Rishi Kapoor's cameo as the adorable Goel saab, wedding planner/caterer and Raghu's father figure rolled in one, is a delectable value-add to the film. Quite apt that an effort that strives to reorganise the Bollywood romance should be produced by Yash Raj Films. Shuddh Desi Romance isn't making any drastic bid to change the filmy concept of love. It is still operating with all that has ever worked for the genre. Only, desi mush gets rid of its designer bursts and comes alive with shuddh honesty this time.</Review>

How then, do director Maneesh Sharma (of Band Baaja Baaraat fame) and one of the finest contemporary writers, celebrated Jaideep Sahni (Khosla ka Ghosla, Chak De, Rocket Singh) hit the refresh button on the eternal triangle? They do three things: First, they focus on characters instead of a plot. The plot is propelled on its winding path purely based on the protagonists' mental state at the time, their backstories, their aspirations, and their selfish (with one critical exception) motives. Above all, it is a gnawing sense of insecurity that pushes them to act in a manner that makes plotting look deft and effortless. A section of the audience will strongly empathize, even. Second, they embrace the risque. Most Bollywood romcoms hurtle towards a wedding with orthodoxy and common tradition integral to plot. SDR unequivocally endorses live-in relationships, multiple affairs, and even little vices like smoking and chicanery at work without being judgmental. They do this consciously and comfortably because the characters are inherently good people. Not grey. Just plain good. Finally, they set the story in a town that bridges the two Indias and surround the principal players with conservative minds. This is not Bombay or Delhi (where the seismic shock of what the three are up to would be felt no further than their homes' main doors) but Jaipur. And where is the hero, hopeless romantic Raghuram Sitaram who can't seem to commit, employed? With a grand old man who organizes weddings of course. On occasion the correctness of its defiance is stifling. The women are the stronger characters here, whipping the hero to do their bidding. Even the title - Shuddh Desi Romance - suggests that this is how things are - not only with our characters, but with society, the youth - now deal with it. Not that anyone should have a problem with it but you can't help but feel the telling might seem implicitly sanctimonious. There's a hack for this. See SDR not as a champion of dhuddh or desi, but a victory for romance. Long, smart cyclic scenes with fluid, conversational dialogue make up the first half. Sharma shoots without usual YRF production design baggage, consistently finding elegance in the decrepit. In a wonderful morning after scene she pushes him off the bed to fetch him cigarettes while she makes them a cup of tea, all the while soaking in the early sun as the radio tattles on. They live with abandonment in the present while simultaneously being guarded about the future. Sahni's dialogue is top-notch throughout. The film builds from there and reaches an exciting point at the cusp of the climax. Impossible choices must be made and we wait with bated breath. Alas, the screenplay gives into convenience and shields the hero from making a call that would lessen his stock with the audience. We'd probably feel cheated in either case. But here is where it slips before ambling on to an appropriate end. Parineeti Chopra is excellent as she tempers her feisty avatar with confusion and hesitation, for hers is the most complex role in the film. Sushant Singh Rajput is the yang to her yin: timid for most part but flirting confidently at unexpected moments. Their interactions are perky and there's always edginess in their relationship. Rishi Kapoor manages his indulgent food, impressive moustache, and matchmaker uncle duties with relative naturalness. Newcomer Vaani Kapoor is confident but falters while playing catch up with her co-actors. Should you watch Shuddh Desi Romance? Yes. It's light, it's unconventional, it's still Bollywood, and it breaks the fourth wall in more ways than one. Ignore the hiccups, and there's no reason you won't enjoy it.</Review>

As Rishi Kapoor�s character suggests, there is a need to take a poignant pause before fatigue sets in.  A story about three characters � Raghu (Sushant), Gayatri (Parineeti) and Tara (Vaani) who fall in and out of love, chase each other, cross paths at the oddest times � the film has a raw appeal to it. Set in Jaipur, we often relate to the situations and emotions the characters go through. Be it the first pangs of love, the cold sweat before walking up to the mandap, or that strange feeling of being desired by your ex even after a break up, most of the scenes seem real. SDR is extremely mushy yet stark and brutal in the same vein. What�s hot Jaideep Sahni�s writing is superb. He makes even the regular exchanges between characters seem interesting. Here he has the delight of working with an ensemble that�s so fresh and full of spunk. Sushant is in his element, and thankfully doesn�t try to ape Ranveer Singh, given the tone of the character. He is funny and extremely likeable in his scenes with Parineeti whose super casual and cool approach to playing Gayatri is so refreshing. So, her lighting up a cigarette or squatting on the floor uninhibitedly never feels forced or a trick. Vaani�s character is the weakest among the three, but she manages to give a convincing performance. Her scene with Sushant perched atop the hill in the second half shows her efficiency as a performer. What�s not In the second half, the pace plays the spoilsport. Also conversations seem a bit lengthy and stretched. Vaani�s sudden exit and the logic leading to it after she speaks to Parineeti seems too rushed. The moments where the characters speak their thoughts out aloud to the camera don�t work. The curse of the second half takes the fun away from the light and frothy first. The bathroom episodes get a bit repetitive, especially during the wedding scene leading to the climax. What to do Refreshing, light, breezy and engaging, SDR will appeal to those who want a realistic take on love and is miles away from the usual patented formula</Review>

The second half ... Raghu-(Sushant)-the-Romeo is a tourist guide in Jaipur, who also doubles up as rental baraati for Goyal (Rishi), a shaadi planner. He meets the rebellious Gayatri (Parineeti) and feels a &quot;tezwala&quot; attraction towards her. They waste no time in moving in, and making out. Soon, they're love-addicts, but commitment-phobic. The third character in this threesome (don't expect any of that) is Tara (Vaani), who was supposed to wed Raghu, until he fled on his wedding day. She makes a re-entry for revenge, but ends up with a complicated status, really. Sushant swings between the Patiala-clad women and makes for the perfectly confused, charming and lovable Romeo. His hair perfectly styled at all times (though he should have had the 'out-of-bed' look more often), his clothes are more designer than dehati, but he more than makes up for it with his desi cool performance. Parineeti is a phataka, firing dialogues (smoking up too) and living it up. She makes the character her own, complementing Sushant with a casualness that's commendable. Newbie Vaani is impressive, pretty and commands a good screen-presence. Rishi Kapoor, blows you away yet again with his incredible histrionics. Maneesh Sharma's 'SDR' has a 'Band Bajaa Baraat' blend, but the essence lies in the conversational chemistry between the characters, some beautifully captured moments and slice-of-life scenes. He doesn't play safe, which is good, but the second half seems repetitive. The concept is engaging, but the plot is little shudd, little desi and quite confused.

Yes, that's the new age romance projected in the film Shuddh Desi Romance coming from the stable that believed in all the romantic cliches possible for the longest time. Times are changing, the youth today considers marriage just a societal norm confounding the idea of love and confining two people into a prison of societal legalities. The present generation is all about exploring, not just themselves but even their partners till they turn cent per cent sure about them. Who would've thought that the man who reveled in the ideology of marriages in Band Baaja Baaraat would present such a modern take of the present small town romance? But Maneesh Sharma surprises you by showing some of the most vulnerable realities of the current general. Stuck in a stuffy rustic bus that's going to the marriage venue Raghu Ram Sitaram (Sushant Singh Rajput) is suffering from pre-marital jitters just while developing a new attraction towards his fake sister Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra) among the fake baraatis. Just while discussing his problem he ends up kissing her. But unlike the coy women of the yore she doesn't make a hue and cry about it and asks him to consider it his problem and forget about it. But Raghu doesn't and instead runs away from his marriage venue leaving his would be bride Tara (Vaani Kapoor) stranded. He then chances upon a meeting with Gayatri again, attraction gives in to liking and the two start living in, as a logical (rather societal) next step they decide to marry but uncertain of a guy who runs away from his own marriage, Gayatri dumps him on the marriage night and runs away too. That's when comes the re-entry of Tara and in inexplicable circumstances the two hit it off. Things are going fine till Raghu finds himself in a love triangle when Gayatri decides to make a U-Turn. The idea of presenting the insecurities of the young hearts is absolutely brilliant. However, it's the execution of it all that takes a hit bringing the film down. The movie, although breezy in the first half, slumps never to rise again in the second. Moreover, it's the repetitive nature of the storyline in the second that leaves you extremely disappointed. Sushant Singh is a nothing but Ranveer Singh of Band Baaja Baaraat. One wonders what the guideline must've been by the director to Sushant, ape Ranveer? For the actor who despite tremendous potential and looks that can leave women weak on their knees gets mired by a repetitive performance. Parineeti Chopra too should stop taking up roles that appear exactly like her debut film. There's no novelty in her role this time around as well. Debutant actress Vaani Kapoor doesn't impress either. One only finds her smiling in every scene irrespective whether it demands her to or not. To sum it up, Shuddh Desi Romance packs a brilliant concept of modern day relationships in a garbled and repetitive packaging. Quite disappointing.</Review>

It's often considered taboo and spoken about disapprovingly by the orthodox in towns and also by several people living in a metropolis. SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE is, perhaps, the first Hindi film that looks at live-in relationships and pre-marital sex in the heartland [Jaipur] of India. Sure, Yash Raj did have a look at live-in relationships in SALAAM | NAMASTE, but that film, if you recall, was set in Australia. Maneesh Sharma, who helmed the immensely likeable BAND BAAJA BAARAAT and appealing-in-parts LADIES VS RICKY BEHL, is ready to undertake an uncharted trail in his third excursion SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE. This time, he talks of love, attraction and commitment in a real space. The question is, how open-minded are we today? With SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE, Maneesh makes a heartfelt attempt to decode and decipher several issues pertaining to intricate relationships. True to its title, SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE is indeed a shuddh [pure] take at live-in relationships involving desi characters and looks at the highs and lows that come with it. Although the spectator has, over the decades, witnessed innumerable interpretations of love and romance, Maneesh and writer Jaideep Sahni make sure they don't take a leaf out of been-there-seen-that kind of situations. Instead, they ensure that the three characters in SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE follow their hearts and don't succumb to the diktats of the society. Also, they speak an uninhibited lingo, which hasn't been spoken in Hindi films earlier. They are not rebellious, but straightforward. And that, in all honesty, is the prime reason that gives this film an edge. SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE is the journey of three restless young people who junk the society's syllabus for finding love and decide to follow their heart. Raghu [Sushant Singh Rajput], a tourist guide in Jaipur, wants a love in his life... Gayatri [Parineeti Chopra], a part-time instructor in an English-speaking institute, has been around the block a few times and knows the scene... Tara [Vaani Kapoor], who's dying to get out there and fly, knows what's right for her, but a little experimenting never hurt anybody, did it?... When their lives crisscross, their beliefs get challenged and their loves, tested. Writer Jaideep Sahni, who has penned films like BUNTY AUR BABLI, CHAK DE! INDIA, AAJA NACHLE and ROCKET SINGH: SALESMAN OF THE YEAR for Yash Raj, opts for a plot that's borrowed from slice of life. The characters in SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE mirror the mindset of several youngsters in contemporary times and how the meaning of love and commitment has undergone a complete change in the present context. The obstacles in the form of caste, religion and culture seem pass�, frankly. Dating, pre-marital sex and marriage are three diverse issues, unlike earlier times, when matrimony was a beautiful culmination in a relationship... Armed with an unsullied plot and creative situations, director Maneesh Sharma breaks away from the conventional thought process and paints a picture that challenges the mindset of the conformists. Additionally, everything that Maneesh and Jaideep attempt to convey through their characters in SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE looks credible and relevant. The good thing is, there's no preaching or sermonizing vis-�-vis who's right or wrong; it's more of a dialogue with our peers. You need to change with the times and cinema needs to grow as well. This film does exactly that without belittling the traditional beliefs. More significantly, all of this is presented in an entertaining format. The only glitch in the otherwise smooth narrative is that the pacing slows down considerably in the second hour. Also, Vaani's stance is a little difficult to absorb. In fact, her exit -- without offering any concrete reason -- looks a bit unreal. However, all said and done, the commitment-phobic attitude of the new generation comes across very well in the narrative. Sachin-Jigar's soundtrack garnishes the goings-on wonderfully. The gifted composers, who have delivered musical hits in the past, live up to the faith reposed in them. 'Gulabi' and the title track are infectious compositions. The DoP captures the rustic flavor with meticulousness. After leaving a tremendous impression in his first Hindi outing, Sushant Singh Rajput wows you with a remarkable portrayal yet again. He brings a lot of freshness with his unpretentious and spontaneous act. Parineeti Chopra gets into the bindaas zone yet again, a role that's become synonymous with her of late. She seems to be going from strength to strength with every film. Vaani Kapoor is self-assured and doesn't seem overwhelmed by her skilled co-stars. Rishi Kapoor is, like always, in terrific form. Rajesh Sharma is okay in a cameo. On the whole, SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE caters to the youth and reflects the mindset of a chunk of the youth these days. The film, which speaks a different lingo, is a gutsy attempt that defies the stereotype. Told in an entertaining format, it is sure to strike a chord with not just the youngsters, but also with those who love shudh [unchartered, in this case] storylines. Refreshingly different, give this one a chance. Recommended!</Review>

It's a coincidence that the second worst Hindi film I had the misfortune of watching is also a remake of a classic 70s hit - 'Zanjeer'. Directed by Apoorva Lakhia, who has previously unleashed such atrocities on our senses as 'Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost' and 'Mission Istanbul', the new 'Zanjeer' isn't just a bad film, it's a shameless exercise in laziness. As anyone who watches movies for a living will tell you, there's some merit to be found even in awful films...a nicely picturised song perhaps, or a decent performance from a random supporting actor, possibly a relevant message buried somewhere in the mess. But I'm afraid there's nothing polite that can be said about 'Zanjeer'. Prakash Mehra's 1973 film starred Amitabh Bachchan as an upright cop pitted against a corrupt system. Superbly written by Salim-Javed, the movie shrewdly tapped into the nation's collective frustration, and the Angry Young Man was born. Lakhia's version features Telugu star Ram Charan as ACP Vijay Khanna, hot on the trail of oil Mafiosi Teja (Prakash Raj). Priyanka Chopra is Mala, an NRI girl and sole witness to a gruesome murder that could link Teja to the adulterated petrol scam. Closely following the blueprint of the earlier film, Vijay is helped in his mission by reformed illegal car dealer Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt). There's an informant too, in the form of an honest crime reporter (Atul Kulkarni), who at one point gives Vijay crucial information about Teja's operations, all the while dancing in a Ganpati procession. Not satisfied at being a hollow imitation, the new 'Zanjeer' is embarrassingly ill-conceived and is packed with howlers from start to finish. Sanjay Dutt's Sher Khan and our cop hero first engage in what comes off as a comedic fight scene that leaves them panting for breath. The next moment, they're bonding during a Playstation game. At another point in the film, while asking that Vijay be protected, Sher Khan says: "Woh mera dost hai. Aur waise bhi Hindustan mein sher aur dost, dono ki kami hai". Dressed in badly-fitted gaudy suits and constantly pawing his moll (Mahie Gill in a career-ending performance) while delivering sleazy double-meaning lines like "Mona Darling, apna moonh sirf ek cheez ke liye kholna please", Prakash Raj can't recreate the gloriously over-the-top guilty pleasure that was Ajit in the role of the original Teja. The film, in fact, is a treasure chest of corny dialogue, with the choicest lines reserved for Prakash Raj. During a lavish meal with his associates, Teja says, "Chicken and chicks are the two meows of life." While bribing Atul Kulkarni in a private theatre filled with skimpily-clad white women, he points to one lady and says to the reporter: "How about a massage? She gives the best happy ending." Lakhia cobbles together powerful moments from the original 'Zanjeer', but he brings neither imagination nor depth in his telling. In a cringe-inducing rehash of the memorable morgue scene, as the background score swells, Vijay tells Mala rather tritely, "I thought being a woman, you'd have a heart". Meanwhile, the famous confrontation scene with Sher Khan in the police station feels strangely muted because Ram Charan can't muster up the seething intensity that Bachchan brought to that moment. Ram Charan, in fact, a successful and popular star in Telugu films, comes off as stiff as a wax statue in his Bollywood debut, with barely any emotion, forget brooding anger. His biceps pop out of his uniform, but he barely flexes his facial muscles. Ram Charan never gets under the skin of Vijay Khanna, making it hard to look beyond his kohl-lined eyes and his neatly styled hair. A portly Sanjay Dutt, his wardrobe comprising bright pathani suits, pretty much sleepwalks through his scenes as Sher Khan. Buried under bad prosthetic make up, or the result of too many hangovers, his eyes and face appear hard as a rock. But the most grating performance comes from Priyanka Chopra, who was so good in last year's 'Barfi', you have to wonder if that role sucked all the talent right out of her. Like a six year old on a sugar high, she chatters away inanities without pausing for breath; her Mala an idiot version of Jaya Bachchan's memorable take on the character. Having said that, the blame for this film rests squarely with its makers - co-writer and director Apoorva Lakhia, and Prakash Mehra's own sons who have produced this drivel. If the new 'Zanjeer' was merely a badly made film, you could dismiss the makers as talentless brats. But their biggest crime here is that they don't so much as try to make a decent film. Their movie stinks of a blatant disregard for the audience's intelligence and entertainment. It's an obvious attempt to cash in on the brand 'Zanjeer' and offer nothing in return. I'm going with zero out of five, for the new 'Zanjeer'. Without belittling their year-long battle with the film's makers to be compensated for remaking their script, one has to wonder if screenwriters Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar might consider donating some part of their settlement towards admitting these guys in film school.</Review>

Forty years ago, Prakash Mehra made his Zanjeer, with Amitabh Bachchan as Inspector Vijay Khanna, a cop with serious anger management issues, brought on by a murder he witnessed as a child, Jaya Bahaduri as a reluctant witness to a gang killing, Pran as the noble-hearted Pathan-ka-bachcha, the marvelously mannered Ajit as Bad Guy Teja, and Bindu as the bursting-out-of-her-sequinned-slinkiness Mona Darling. That 1973 Zanjeer turned into a superhit, and kickstarted Bachchan's rise and rise in Hindi cinema. That 40-year-old flick is to be seen forever running on a loop on a movie channel or two. Despite its hamminess (Pran took the word 'ham' to sublime levels with his dire auburn wig-and kohl-eyed goonda-turned-good Sher Khan), and its quotient of melodrama, that Prakash Mehra film remains a zinger. It gave us the Bollywood hero with the longest legs, in all senses of the word, and a prototype plot -- cops vs robbers-- which never tires unless done badly. And then you watch this new Zanjeer and you get started with the whys. Implicit in all remakes is the idea that you are refreshing the film, both for those who may have seen the original, as well as for newbies ( in the screening I was at, I found someone who, gasp, hadn't seen the old one). The filmmakers have been carefully calling it a "tribute", and they have added a couple of elements which weren't in the older film, but to me it was a neither here-nor-there thing: it's neither faithful remake nor campy, knowing tribute. It's just a poor copy. So why? Ram Charan, who plays the new Vijay, has the physique for it. He's tall and hunky and buffed (though that puffed-up hair is straight out of a styling salon) and has the most delicious come-hither heavy lashed eyes. I saw him first in his Telugu superhit Magadheera, a back-to-the-future revenge piece which I loved: he was doing in Telugu what all superstars around the country do in all languages. He was jokey, danced as well as his leading lady, and landed a mean punch. All of which Ram Charan tries to bring to the table here, but he is more fumble than finesse. Bollywood is a different terrain, and you can see him shifting constantly for a better fit, but except for some action sequences, it doesn't happen. What can he do if he has to act opposite a dumb blonde version of a Bollywood ditz, the NRI Mala who is in India to attend a Facebook friend's wedding ( yes, that's right), and who wants to run back to her Daddy, and not give gawaahi in the murder she witnesses? Priyanka Chopra is even more of a misfit here, with not one shred of her usual intelligence showing through in her over-the-top-squeaky-girliness. Why?Poor Prakash Raj. He really seems to be the go-to villain these days, but we've been seeing him doing the same thing too many times over. His Teja lives in a gargoyle of a palace somewhere in Mumbai, with a swimming pool, loyal henchmen, and curvaceous moll Mona Darling (Gill) who may be the silliest prop in the film. The nakli dawaai of the older film is replaced by nakli petrol: the oil mafia, which skims over the top, and sells in the open market, and which is being investigated by sharp investigative reporter Atul Kulkarni, accompanied by a hanger-on of a female colleague. That kind of treatment was very much of a product of its time. It makes no sense now. Going by this Zanjeer, Mumbai still has only one cop who is capable of weeding out the baddies (his sidekicks are cartoons), only one journo who wants to break stories, only one really bad guy, and that one fellow who turns from bad-to-good in the blink of an eye (Sanjay Dutt is Sher Khan, all togged out in techni-coloured Pathani suits and scarred cheeks, has the dubious privilege to react to this iconic line: "yeh tumhaare baap ka ghar nahin, police station hai". He also gets to dance, fight off a dozen men at the same time, and save the hero's life. There's a part in which this Teja and Mona Darling are seen watching an excerpt from that Zanjeer, in which Ajit and Bindu are shown cosying up, and you instantly get nostalgic. In this instance, old is certainly gold. And new is dross. There really is nothing in this film that catches your eye except for a few set pieces, and a new male face which could make some space for himself if he gets something better. The rest is best described by a dialogue in the film which goes thus: "that was work, this is a hangover".</Review>

But I bet they hadn't seen the film. In fact, the defendants' primary weapon should've been a screening of the movie itself; that would've taken the fight out of the celebrated writer duo. With this mauling, did they even have a case? Zanjeer retains the characters' names from the original, Vijay's horsey nightmares and ... that's it really. Where the original was a perfectly timed piece of cinema that reflected the mood of a nation embodied in an impassioned performance by Amitabh Bachchan, Lakhia's version just doesn't cut it by any measure. The screenplay strives to be smart. It brings in an oil mafia angle and, not so subtly, the J Dey murder conspiracy. Plot jumps (occasionally relying on your memory of the original!), cardboard characters, and rank lack of originality smite any chance of Zanjeer being a fulfilling cinematic experience. Movies that intend to entertain - with their item songs and dialogue such as "woman, open your mouth for one thing only" - should refrain from overstepping the moral framework they create for themselves. They end up caricaturizing and doing a disservice to real people and consequential incidents. Remember RGV's Attacks of 26/11? Ther acting is dismal. Priyanka Chopra hams her way through her scenes in complete denial and Ram Charan puts all his intensity into his scowl, leaving no room for other expressions or, indeed, acting. As for Prakash Raj ... well, he's the same character as he's in every film, only this time in a variety of fancy suits and bowler hats. And oh, there's Mahie Gill too. She mostly meows and makes sounds that would have had the dubbing engineer sniggering on the other side of the studio. If Salim-Javed do watch this film, one wouldn't be surprised if they decided to give the money and 'core story' credit back and disassociate themselves from this embarrassment of a "remake". In this distressing time of remakes and hand-me-down inspirations, let's remember Herman Melville, "It is better to fail at originality than to succeed in imitation." Zanjeer manages neither.</Review>

Don was still understandable, Agneepath too. But if you can't get an actor who can use silences to emote aggression you should not fiddle with an original that pretty much defined new-age violence for the Hindi screen. It is pointless saying comparisons will not crop up, every frame of Apoorva Lakhia's remake shouts out reasons why it shouldn't have been made. The remarkable thing about Prakash Mehra's 1973 original was its underplayed angst. Lakhia's version goes over the top with dumb action and dumber drama. Essentially, he fobs off Salim-Javed's original idea, passes it off with a few tweaks, and gives it mindless treatment. Zanjeer 2013 looks like one of those noisy south Indian remakes Bollywood regularly peddles rather than a tribute to one of the greatest commercial films of Hindi cinema. Debutant Ram Charan looks uncomfortable trying to add a new dimension to inspector Vijay Khanna. Vijay is gunning for the oil mafia boss Teja (Prakash Raj), incidentally also the man who killed his parents. Priyanka Chopra plays Mala, NRI who lands in India for a FaceBook friend's wedding, does a raunchy item and becomes a witness to a murder by Teja's gang, which would remind you of the Yashwant Sonawane killing of 2011. Since Mala is too scared to testify, Vijay gives her shelter in his home. Their evident love story is too cold. Sanjay Dutt gets the tough job of reinventing Pran's iconic Sher Khan. His spirited bid falls flat owing to weak characterisation. Mahie Gill's Mona Darling looks plastic, only rivalled by Prakash Raj's silly flamboyance. Zanjeer 1973 was about raging vengeance, the account of an orphan who finds reason to exist in the very insecurities that torment him. Zanjeer 2013 makes vengeance look like a dull video game. Like its hero on screen, the film too has no reason to exist.</Review>

Sure, it had Amitabh Bachchan at his most primal, all flammable eyes and sincerely-furious baritone. And it had Pran, who brought dignity and warmth to the proceedings. It had dialogue that seared the ear, forged hot by master blacksmiths Salim-Javed. And, like all Prakash Mehra films, the music was sensational. These are what makes it a film we can watch over and over and over, with considerable awe. The new Zanjeer, directed by Apoorva Lakhia, has none of these things. Least of all the hero. Ram Charan makes his Hindi film debut with this Bachchan remake, and my heart goes out to his fans who will have to sit through this tediously trashy film. To paraphrase an unforgettable Indian movie character who shares a name with this new hero: Teja tum ho, marks idhar hain -- alas, it isn�t anywhere close to a passing grade, son. You shouldn�t have bloody tried. The writing is bafflingly bad. �Investigations start karo,� says the hero, a second before cops start whacking everyone in sight. At some point a character launches into a bizarre tirade against the Discovery Channel, which is apparently the channel of choice for the car-thieves demographic. A bawdy joke clearly written in English about one�s, um, �member� is translated sloppily into �mere mehmaan�, and is soon followed up by an offensively bad fellatio joke. And yet all this excruciating slop is preferable to when they use the original lines. Because they go right ahead and do their take on that most iconic of scenes, the one where Amitabh Bachchan kicks the chair out from under Pran and -- words scorching, eyes blazing -- ordering him to stay standing, informs him what a police station is not. Making Ram Charan play out this scene with Sanjay Dutt as Sher Khan is a brazenly stupid move, as if the makers of this enterprise lost all interest and decided to flaunt their utter incompetence with fanfare. Dutt ambles toward a chair, and Ram -- who stares at it before kicking it -- does so with a perfunctory scowl, the kind reserved for hanging up the phone after a wrong number. The chair itself is an office chair with wheels, so instead of flying violently across the station, this too perambulates blithely out of the screen. It�s all casually catastrophic. The words �Sanjay Dutt as Sher Khan� might have struck fear into some of your hearts, and I�m here to reassure you that the result is exactly as woebegone as it sounds. Dutt sleepwalks through Pran�s iconic role, looking demented during the Yaari hai imaan dance and lazy the rest of the time, even during fight scenes. At one point he beats away assailants like they were errant pinatas, and at another -- during his big, crucial fight scene with Ram Charan -- he and his rival look too physically drained to square off against each other, like Street Fighter ran out of batteries. A lame fight is apparently what passes for male bonding in the Lakhia universe, and a few scenes later both of them are playing car-racing games on a Playstation. Dutt, if only to provide us with a tragic metaphor, continues to grapple violently with his controller, mashing the buttons even though his car has already crashed and burned. Whenever Dutt appears on screen, the background score switches to that of an operatic crescendo, like a rejected cut of something that�d play behind an Old Spice commercial. Background score man Amar �BringYourEarplugs� Mohile has a blast in this film, having made three or four music cues -- others include an Inception-y blare, and a Mission Impossible riff -- and clicking through them with high-volume recklessness, without care or nuance. It�s the stuff of particularly loud nightmares, this. But even the ear-pillaging Mohile shuts up for the superloud heroine. The only positive from Priyanka Chopra�s performance in this film is that she hasn�t dragged in Pitbull. She plays a hyper-talkative bimbette -- in her words, a �simple NRI ladki� -- who talks nineteen to the dozen but, forget about matching up to Jaya Bachchan from the original, she serves only to show us how tough it must have been for Kareena Kapoor to pull off Poo. Chopra�s character, Mala, is a moron who mistakes Stockholm Syndrome for pyaar. I didn't think it was possible to bring smugness into a giggle, but Chopra -- made of plastic, so fantastic -- looks to be giggling at the fact that she can giggle. And then there�s Ram Charan, a cop so tough he wears only two inscrutable expressions. He struts around trying to look hardcore, but clearly there is a reason why it takes someone like Salman Khan to make a stupid actioner work. This new boy has zero screen presence, possibly worsened by the Hindi dubbing, and taking on one of Bachchan�s Vijays is particularly suicidal. When the film mercifully ends, some remixed song has the gall to play Bachchan�s voice saying that �yeh police station hai� line, which seems particularly cruel to young, unimpressive Ram. That voice just puts into perspective how simian this new hero has appeared in this unwarranted, atrocious remake -- and we shouldn�t monkey around with Amitabh.</Review>
      <Review Id="171" Name="Rachit Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.filmfare.com/reviews/movie-review-zanjeer-4117.html" Affiliation="Filmfare" Date="6th Sept, 2013" Likes="2" Rating="on the website">A girl covered in oil sings while a muscular man in a black hooded overcoat slashes around a fancy dagger. It�s supposed to be an opening sequence, the kind you see before James Bond movies. One assumes its purpose is to make Zanjeer seem a little exotic. It�s certainly a first in Hindi movies. It makes little sense given Zanjeer is a film about an angry young man and not a well-dressed super spy. But it at least acts as a precursor to the hero�s war against the oil mafia. That�s 2013�s Zanjeer for you. It�s a lavishly budgeted and very indulgent reboot. But as any wise film guru will tell you, more money doesn�t get you better movie. Apoorva Lakhia�s movie loves to borrow. It takes the legacy of Prakash Mehra�s original but it also slavishly scrounges scenes from Hollywood movies like The Artist, True Lies and many more. In doing so it turns the angry young man�s saga into a run-of-the-mill action movie. Like the original, Vijay (Ram Charan) is troubled by the nightmare of a white horse prancing in a beastly manner. It reminds him of the horrific memory of his parents being murdered by the hooded fellow who was dancing with a dagger in the opening sequence. The killer has a horse tattooed on his forearm. Nonetheless, it�s the nightmare that�s supposed to give Vijay his angst. But in all fairness his devil-may-care attitude looks cockier than misplaced anger. Sometimes you just think he has steroid induced rage. Who beats up people half to death because they�re causing traffic nuisance? Even if they�re bad guys, Ram Charan�s Vijay is a little too intensely violent. His rage is directed towards the oil mafia that�s headed by a guy who�s straight out of the National Lampoon films. Prakash Raj�s Teja dresses like Bourgeois, uses XXL packs of Viagra and has a plastic gold gun. Oh and he watches reruns of 1973�s Zanjeer with his love interest Mona. And then you have Priyanka Chopra, who�s Mala, an NRI from New York. She performs item numbers at her Facebook friend�s wedding while going under the alias of Pinky. Unfortunately she witnesses a murder and becomes Vijay�s aide in cracking on the oily bad guys. Also helping Vijay is Sanjay Dutt as Sher Khan. He�s just a good hearted mafia member. He even gives up years of his illegal business because Vijay exchanges a few manly blows with him. Their bromance adds a nice touch of levity to the proceedings.   In all seriousness, watching Zanjeer can be a funny experience. At times you feel it�s a homage, at times you feel it�s a parody and then sometimes you feel it�s a YouTube video. This big ticket movie is unfair to the talents of its actors. Watch Telugu movies like Chirutha, Magadheera and Racha to know what Ram Charan is actually capable of. But this is showbiz. Most people will forget this movie in no time. That�s the sad truth.</Review>

Yes, that's exactly the label that should plastered in big, bold letters on remakes which try to make a cult film contemporary under the guise of giving a tribute. While some, if handled by creative geniuses, ends up becoming successes again, like Agneepath, most end up falling short and biting the dust. Apoorva Lakhia's Zanjeer, remake of its namesake made by Prakash Mehra lands in the latter category. A brutally honest cop Vijay Khanna (Ram Charan) lands himself in Mumbai after being transferred from Andhra Pradesh for the nth time. He is given the case to seal the nexus of oil mafia Teja (Prakash Raj) who gets highlighted after a murder by his gang. The witness of the murder is Mala (Priyanka Chopra) who initially refuses to cooperate but eventually budges and helps Vijay out only to land herself on the radar of Teja. In order to save her life while putting an end to Teja's nefarious and illegal activities, Vijay makes her take refuge in his house. He also encounters (Sher Khan) who is into buying and selling of illegal cars. Seeing Vijay's honesty and determination, Sher Khan turns over a new leaf and mends his ways to transform into a person who now only goes by the book. He has made Vijay a friend for life and will do anything to help him out. How the two uproot Teja's illegal empire is what follows through the rest of the plot. Apoorva Lakhia who has a superhit like Shootout At Lokhandwala to his credit goes all out to wipe off any credibility in his work with this feeble attempt. Right from the start of the film where you have a skimpily clad greasy unknown model crooning to the title track during the credits to the entry scene of Vijay Khanna, you know the film is a letdown even before it comes to culmination. The story of the remake is pretty much alike its predecessor barring the exception of the setting. The spurious liquor backdrop of the olden times turns itself into oil smuggling in this one. Even characters become contemporary for example a simple "chakku-churi" girl Mala gets a modern makeover and finds herself as a Gujarati NRI. Even the slick and stylish appearance of Teja gets converted into a buffoon-y, indulgent and psychotic Teja. The changes aren't completely for the good for while Prakash Raj manages to hold fort, Priyanka Chopra as the loud, blonde babe turns out to be excruciatingly annoying. Son of South superstar Chiranjeevi and a superstar in his own right down South Ram Charan takes up a humungous task of stepping into the shoes of iconic superstar Amitabh Bachchan for his debut film itself. To essay a character which earned Amitabh Bachchan the title of 'angry young man', is no cake walk and Ram completely gets burdened by the weight. Not only does his dubbed voice gets identified easily, his perpetual angry face doesn't add to his character. The only few moments you do enjoy in the film are that of Sanjay Dutt purely for the experience the superstar holds, however, that too takes a hit when he gets made to do funny dance and fight sequences that work against his gait. To sum it up, the new-age Zanjeer doesn't hold half as much promise as the cult classic did and literally falls flat on its face. Watch the old one once again and forget about this.</Review>

A film that gave Amitabh Bachchan the �angry young man� title and paved the way for a generation of film makers wanting to imitate and aspire to replicate the sentiment of a young police officer  who puts an end to crime and cleans up the system.  Vijay (Ram Charan) is a honest police officer who faces the brunt of his superiors for wanting to fight corruption and expose the oil mafia. In charge of a case he stumbles upon Mala  (Priyanka Chopra), the witness who he ends up protecting and romancing. Teja (Prakash Raj) is the head of the oil mafia with a Mona (Mahie) as his bimbo seductress.  Wanting to cash in on the remake craze, Lakhia uses every trick in his book to make this one watchable. But does he succeed? What�s hot The action scenes, especially the introductory fight encounter between Teja and Dutt is well choreographed. The background score is over the top, yet it brings in the right amount of drama when required. Ram Charan is earnest in his approach and oozes the right amount of confidence especially when he�s standing next to senior actors. Priyanka�s bubbly act has some enjoyable moments, but we wish she put a restraint order on those giggles! Pinky song comes in early but has an infectious beat and is well shot. What�s not Zanjeer struggles to find its own ground. The first half is a land mine of unnecessary songs and hackneyed dialogues that seem written for an audience for a different era. Whenever Lakhia tries to create a reference point to the original or recreate a moment, the initiative falls flat. It�s not just originality but also lack of novelty that mars the film from being anything but ordinary. Prakash Raj needs a break from playing the same roles where his accent and bulging eyes do the rehearsed cha cha cha routine.  Mahie Gill�s Mona looks like a Comedy Circus aspirant who never made it to the finale. Priyanka and Ram Charan�s chemistry takes a back beating as one goes overboard with emoting while the other underplays it beyond belief. What to do Zanjeer doesn�t hold a candle to the original, instead it feels like a modern day adaptation of a yet another cop drama.</Review>

The original film earned Amitabh Bachchan the epithet 'angry young man' and made him world-famous. The 2013 action thriller brings Andhra icon Chiranjeevi's son, Ram Charan (also an Andhra superstar) to Bollywood. It retains the key plot points and the main characters are rechristened Vijay (Ram Charan), Mala ( Priyanka Chopra), Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt), Teja (Prakash Raj) and Mona (Mahie Gill) just like the original. Yet, this film should be judged as a stand-alone offering because attempts to compare the two versions will find the current one falling short, especially in the dialogue and music departments. Nostalgia happens when some original dialogue like 'Yeh police station hai, tere baap ka ghar nahi' and 'Sher Khan beimaani ka dhanda bhi imaandari se karta hai' are uttered. To reprise the plot, Zanjeer is the story of an idealistic cop, Vijay Khanna, wanting to bring criminals to the book. Set in Andhra Pradesh, the initial part sets the stage for how dons and ministers have more clout with and within the administration, than an honest policeman. As a result, Vijay is transferred 17 times within AP. In his 18th assignment in Mumbai, this Assistant Commissioner of Police takes on an oil mafia don, Teja (Prakash Raj). Teja fails to strike fear, playing something between Al Capone (Untouchables) and a buffoon. Anyway, whistleblowers are set on fire and uninhibited killings happen on Mumbai streets, making it seem as if the entire khaki force (except Vijay) is asleep. The climax, shot against the backdrop of a Moharram procession, is interesting. Ram Charan, as the brooding policeman, excels in action. His dark eyes with long lashes adeptly convey anger. Sanjay Dutt is competent and lovable. Priyanka looks smashing but is overzealous in the American Born Desi Gujarati Girl act. Mahie Gill as the gangster's girl Mona is raunchy.</Review>
      <Review Id="175" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/550707" Affiliation="bollywoodhungama.com" Date="6th Sept, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">My generation grew up on Amitabh Bachchan's movies and everybody -- film historians included -- know the priceless contribution of ZANJEER [1973] to Big B's illustrious career. For the uninitiated, the tag, 'Angry Young Man', was coined for Bachchan soon after this film hit the screens and made history at the BO. Although a number of films followed [and continue to be made to this date] -- depicting a brooding cop, the fight between honest and evil -- ZANJEER is revered, an iconic film by movie aficionados and enthusiasts. The first time I heard that Apoorva Lakhia was remaking ZANJEER, I must admit, I was appalled. Why would anyone want to play with fire, I asked myself. Remaking an iconic film and reprising the characters of Inspector Vijay Khanna [Big B], Sher Khan [Pran], Mala [Jaya Bachchan], Teja [Ajit] and Mona [Bindu], which have been immortalized by the actors, is a humungous challenge. Sure, the Gen X may/may not be aware of the classic, but those who recall ZANJEER affectionately will find it difficult to see a new set of actors slipping into their fav stars' shoes. The question is, how much has Apoorva Lakhia retained from the all-time classic? The new ZANJEER borrows from the original, but it is more of an updated avatar of that film. The essence remains the same, the characters are similar too, even a dialogue or two has been retained... but let me put it this way -- it's his interpretation of a film that's admired even after four decades of its release. Vijay [Ram Charan] is an honest police officer who has been transferred yet again by the system for chasing the corrupt underworld goons. He is in charge of a case where the key eyewitness, Mala [Priyanka Chopra], has seen a murder by Teja's [Prakash Raj] gang and refuses to co-operate. Teja is the head of the oil mafia operation and doesn't want Mala alive. Vijay manages to convince Mala to give a statement which makes her perpetrators come after her. He gives her shelter in his house to protect her and soon realizes that she is slowly becoming an important part of his life. He also encounters Sher Khan [Sanjay Dutt], who is into buying and selling of illegal cars. Seeing Vijay's honesty and determination, Sher Khan turns over a new leaf and mends his ways to transform into a person who now only goes by the book. He has made Vijay a friend for life and will do anything to help him out. Vijay, on the other hand, is also battling his inner demons, where he is searching for his parents' killers. He witnessed their cold blooded murder as a child and the nightmares continue to haunt him till date. The film revolves around Vijay's struggle against the system, his battle against his inner demons and the trail for Teja. Let's get one thing right! ZANJEER is *not* a scene-to-scene reproduction of the earlier film. ZANJEER has a present-day setting, thus catering to today's spectators. Apoorva and his team of writers rely on drama and action to carry the story forward: The conflict between Ram Charan and Prakash Raj works for most parts, while the action is larger-than-life and in sync with what the present-day spectators expect from masala movies. A subject like ZANJEER is totally up Apoorva's alley and without comparing him with his peers, I must state that the director has handled a number of dramatic sequences adroitly, especially the ones between Ram Charan and Sanju and also between Ram Charan and Prakash Raj. It's a double edge-sword for the director, but as a standalone film -- not wanting to color my judgment, since I am a big, big fan of the earlier ZANJEER -- the director does deliver in the second hour specifically. Blemishes? The women in the film don't really work. Priyanka, a fine actress otherwise, is just about okay. And Mahie Gill aka Mona Darling is inadvertently comical. Moreover, the character of the journalist [Atul Kulkarni] is not as convincing. Apoorva also falters because the theme lacks the originality that it had in the 1970s. Haven't we been subjected to hundreds of good versus evil saga over the decades? The soundtrack is another hiccup. You forget all about it the moment you exit the hall. Ram Charan steps into a role that was immortalized by Big B and that's a huge challenge for any actor. The very thought of reprising the iconic character can put you off, but, again, without drawing parallels with Big B's towering act, I must add that Ram Charan acquits himself very well. He plays the honest cop with precision and comes across as a supremely talented actor. Priyanka Chopra just doesn't work. Incidentally, this is the third remake for Priyanka, after DON and AGNEEPATH [all starred Big B in the original versions]. After playing the affable Munnabhai and deadly Kancha Cheena, Sanjay Dutt portrays Sher Khan with gusto. He's first-rate. Prakash Raj is electrifying as the villain. He is venomous to the hilt. Mahie Gill definitely deserved something better. Atul Kulkarni is wasted. Ankur Bhatia is relegated to being Prakash Raj's sidekick. Dayashankar Pandey and Aditya Lakhia try hard to infuse humor in the proceedings. Chetan Pandit is passable. On the whole, ZANJEER is a triumph for Ram Charan, who gets abundant opportunity to exhibit his talent and scores exceedingly well. However, the film comes across as a regular masala fare that caters to the single screen spectator mainly and also for enthusiasts of typical Bollywood entertainers. As for the comparisons with the original ZANJEER, I suggest try not to get there!</Review>

There's a simple line in this sumptuous film that captures its essence beautifully: "Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination." It's a line that might help interpret the film's open ending, but one that also nicely sums up its unique premise. Neglected housewife and caring mother Ila (Nimrat Kaur), determined to spice up her loveless marriage, heeds the advice of a well-meaning Aunty in the flat upstairs (a terrific Bharati Achrekar, heard but never seen) and whips up a killer meal for her husband. But as luck would have it, a rare error in Mumbai's famously efficient dabbawala service results in the tiffin landing up at the desk of a grumpy accountant on the verge of retirement, a widower named Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan). On realizing that her lovingly prepared meal was eaten by someone else, Ila encloses a note in the steel lunchbox the following day. Saajan writes back and this pair of strangers begins a tentative friendship through routinely exchanged letters, sharing with each other their dreams, their memories of loved ones snatched away, and their empty lives. As much a love letter to Mumbai as it is a searing portrait of loneliness, 'The Lunchbox' unfolds against the bustle of this teeming city. Batra and his cinematographer give us skillfully composed sequences of a dabba's long journey from the kitchen to the desk of its intended recipient. We travel with our characters in local trains, buses and taxis; we go into Ila's middle-class cheek-to-jowl apartment block to Saajan's modest Bandra cottage and the dull government office he has worked 35 years at. It's a metro bursting at its seams, and yet our protagonists are lost souls here. The third wheel in this story is Nawazuddin Siddiqui's character Shaikh, a younger officer poised to take over from Saajan. Cheery, optimistic and always making the most of an opportunity, Shaikh forges a bond with the taciturn Saajan despite the dour older man's initial reluctance. You see flashes of Mumbai in Shaikh's personality - it is a city that invites you to embrace it with all its flaws. Nawazuddin is wholly endearing and funny in the role; we're unaccustomed to seeing the actor in this light and it's a sheer delight. Still, it is the two central actors that grab hold of your attention in this story. Irrfan Khan, as the loner who loosens up when he falls in love, makes a nuanced role seem deceptively simple, yet gives Saajan emotional heft. With 'The Lunchbox', Irrfan adds another inspired performance to his extraordinary repertoire. The surprise ingredient here is the relatively unknown Nimrat Kaur as Ila. Playing an insecure hausfrau who gradually blossoms into her own person, the actress doesn't take one wrong step. Spending much of the film alone, she makes Ila entirely believable, yet infuses her with an irresistible luminosity. The unseen hero of this delicious love story is writer-director Ritesh Batra who pulls off a near perfect script that's reflective of a city and the people that live in it. Through the relationships his characters share, Batra displays a great understanding of human nature, embracing its many complexities. He also masterfully blends food into this narrative, turning it into such a sensory experience that you want to rush out of the cinema and tuck into a lovely meal. The single false note in this bittersweet symphony is Lilette Dubey, a tad over-made up, her performance uncharacteristically melodramatic for this subtle film. I'm going with five out of five for 'The Lunchbox'. The greatest love stories are the ones that make you root for the protagonists to come together, despite their destinies. This film illustrates how love transforms the unlikeliest of people; it breaks down Saajan's walls and gives Ila the courage to fly. Treat yourself to 'The Lunchbox' - it'll leave you with a craving to seek your own little happiness. The best film I've seen in a long time.</Review>

You hesitate, look inside. Instead of the everyday, dull industrial food that you pay a monthly sum for, your lunchbox is loaded with home-made goodies that bring a smile to your eyes and mouth. This is food made with love, sweat and tears. This is food for the soul. In one of the best performances you are likely to encounter, Irrfan, playing Saajan Fernandes, makes you see that middle-aged man. Not just see, but feel. That lunch box becomes a symbol of hope. Of a renewed interest in the present. And of a future, waiting to be realised. Ritesh Batra's research on the legendary Mumbai dabbawalas who deliver millions of lunchboxes everyday through the city with unerring accuracy, led to his first feature. 'The Lunchbox' is about a dabba that fetches up at the wrong table, and the tasty fall-out of that little sin. I don't know if those famed dabbawalas have ever made such a mistake, but the result of Batra's mixed-up 'dabbas' is lovely, with a lingering delectable after-taste. Ila (Nimrat Kaur) is a young stay-at-home wife and mother, whose routine � wake up, get kiddo ready, see off hubby, sort out clothes for the wash, get the dabba ready�is leavened by perky chats with an elderly neighbour, whose nosiness we overlook because of her apparent affection for Ila (we never see her, only hear the voice, and then we clock Bharati Achrekar's distinctive accent). She gives Ila pro tips on seasoning and condiments and ingredients, to target her husband's (Nakul Vaid) stomach, and through it, his increasingly indifferent heart . Irrfan says little, letting his body do the talking. He is sitting most of the time we see him. At a desk, piled with crumpled paper, where he crunches numbers. At a table in the office canteen, where he spreads the dabba's wares, starting to come alive again. In his home, cluttered with old memories. Only once, when he is leaning against the balcony, and we see him from behind, does he forget his bent-by-life stance, and that's his only tiny misstep, which you notice only because the rest of it is pitch perfect. He sniffs the dabba's aroma, lets a slow smile build across his face, and we smile right back. Nimrat Kaur is a find. Her Ila is so there, a real woman trying to find her happiness in the little things she does. A whisk of a wrist puts in mirch, haldi and sprinkles dhaniya, and when she hands the dabba to the man at the door, you know it's not just a steel container, but her beating heart. The hand-written notes that come back to her in the dabba, and the notes she writes in response, made me wistful, and hope good things happen to her. And a side note on Nawazuddin, who is a side note in this winsome story on love and loss and longing, who comes through with a beautifully-calibrated act. Shaikh is an irritant, who keeps popping up to accost Saajan to get him to do things he, Saajan, doesn't want : Shaikh understands he is being blown off, and yet keeps his dignity intact. It's hard to take your eyes off Irrfan when he is in full flow, but Nawazuddin demands attention in his own right. If it hadn't been for the occasional flatness, and a couple of predictable notes, there would have been no flaws in this dabba. I also found Ila's mother's (Lillete Dubey) segment, included solely to underline another kind of vacantness, a little forced. But these are tiny niggles in this film that gets the rest of it so right. Batra's characters are a delight. They may be of Mumbai, infused with intense desi flavours, but can inhabit any part of the world. You want to take them home, sit them down at your table, and savour them, one mouthful at a time.</Review>

A widower, Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), lives alone in an aged, slightly dingy house in Bandra, Mumbai, and works at an insurance company as an accountant. He is standoffish and reclusive, almost misanthropic, bogged down by the weight of unexpressed feelings. He silently labours over reams of paper files, and eats his lunch, delivered by a dabbawala, alone at the office�s sparse canteen. Batra, also the screenplay writer, invests Saajan and his surroundings with the kind of existentialism that is all too familiar in a big city. Will someone or something pull Saajan out of his funk? It is a story that would strike a chord with anybody, anywhere. There is not much complexity. It derives its soul and effectiveness in good performances and Batra�s elegant economy in executing his material. Although it is about sad characters, The Lunchbox has a safety-cap of feel-good reassurance. One of the joys of watching a movie is identifying and empathizing with characters that we have known or have ourselves been, and in the consolation that we are not alone. There is also all the Punjabi food that Ila (Nimrat Kaur), the grief-stricken but tenacious lead woman, cooks�we see hands dribbled in batter, before the coated paneer chunks go into simmering oil, and the act of eating with slow relish. Already a global festival favourite, Batra�s film, besides being a very comforting watch, is a representative Indian film in that the food-obsessed Indian is in almost every frame. There is rich material for serious acting here, because Batra�s narrative has no excess, and Khan, in the riveting central role, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nimrat Kaur, make excellent use of it. One day, when Saajan opens his dabba, he discovers that the food he has been eating every day has transformed�it has become delicious. In a serendipitous slip of Mumbai�s efficient dabbawala chain, the dabba meant for him gets switched with that of a man who is in a loveless marriage with Ila. Ila lives in a predominantly Hindu middle-class neighbourhood and is as lonely as Saajan. She tries to be creative with the lunch she sends her husband, in an attempt to rekindle her husband�s interest in her. Ila�s constant companion is a voice (Bharati Achrekar), a lady who lives above her with her comatose husband, who vociferously offers her advice and reminders�I kept thinking of Mrs Wolowitz in Big Bang Theory, but this lady is even funnier. Saajan and Ila begin a bare-it-all correspondence through letters until the highlight of their days becomes the opening of these letters. Meanwhile, a new employee, Aslam (Siddiqui), joins Saajan�s company, to take over Saajan�s work after his impending retirement. Despite Saajan�s deadpan cynicism and Aslam�s sprightly earnestness, the two men forge a bond. Irrfan Khan�s well-gauged depiction of Saajan�s rich inner life and his second attempt at an emotional life is the film�s solid centre. Khan�s capacity to convey pathos has not so far been so effectively extracted. His character spends most of his time alone, and the actor goes for the role with slight shifts of gaze and half smiles. He uses the pithy writing artfully, optimizing their dramatic potential. The Lunchbox is very much Irrfan Khan�s vehicle, and it is hard to imagine anyone filling these shoes so well. Siddiqui�s performance is energetic and effortless. His character is meant to be not just a foil to Saajan, but we are also able to able laugh at Saajan because of Aslam. Aslam has one tone, but Siddiqui makes him endearing and so believable. Thanks to him, the story gets a sense of cheer about the small things, so crucial to keep the momentum of hope going. Nimrat Kaur plays the most demanding role. Ila has more layers because her dilemmas revolve around many roles�mother of a young girl, a helpless daughter, a grudging wife and a person desperate for a �high happiness index�. Kaur is extremely effective in the role. It is the promise of an actor waiting to ripe. The other character in the film is Mumbai the city. The research on the dabbawala system shows; and Batra�s gaze on them is almost like that of a documentarian. Especially resonant in their portrayal are their songs, which they sing in chorus inside local train compartments, clapping their hands in symphony. Cinematographer Michael Simmonds captures the claustrophobia of local trains and human clusters on streets with minimum gimmickry. But the milieus around the characters strike some discordant notes. Saajan Fernandes, perhaps intentionally similar to Scrooge, is unmoved by children playing in his neighbourhood; he has little connection with those who live next door to him, and has no recognizable trait or quirk of a Catholic man living in a close-knit Bandra neighbourhood. Bandra is one of Mumbai�s most distinguishable, electric neighbourhoods. It almost appears as if Batra made Saajan Catholic because he wanted the quaint neighbourhood and the run-down, Portugese -style mansion as his backdrops. Similarly, Ila�s neighbourhood is aspecific and without any character. While being an immensely enjoyable and competent film, the universality of The Lunchbox tends to exclude its setting�s all-important provinciality. The Lunchbox releases in theatres on Friday.</Review>

It never narrated a love story where the lovers don't meet. Ever, not even in one scene. And yet you are left with an overwhelming completeness of emotions as the end credits roll. That's a first that writer-director Ritesh Batra's debut feature serves up, giving love in the time of social networking an impressive new flavour. The Lunchbox, releasing this week after a remarkable tour of the global festival circuit including Cannes, uses an unconventional catalyst to push its love story. Playing Cupid here is food, in a tale about an aging man on the brink of retirement and a homemaker dividing her time between cooking, motherhood and a loveless marriage. Food essentially becomes a character in this film. Not many Bollywood filmmakers have drawn thematic context from gastronomic sights and colours this way - Stanley Ka Dabba comes to mind as a rare recent example - which is what makes The Lunchbox a unique experience. Batra creates a feel-good romance that, departing from norms of the genre in Bollywood, comes with starkly real characters and situations. In an age of email and SMS, The Lunchbox uses the old-fashioned letter as expression of emotions. It is something that gives the film a unique charm. Batra's screenplay focuses on the dabbawallah culture of Mumbai - delivery men who transport lunchboxes from housewives to their husbands in offices. The system has been around for ages and analysis shows the chance of a wrong delivery is one in millions. One such rare error lands the lunchbox Ila (Nimrat Kaur) prepared for her husband on the table of Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan), sarkari babu and loner who is a few months from retiring. Ila discovers the mix-up soon enough, but doesn't inform her husband who wouldn't care anyway. Fernandez doesn't mind, the regular hotel from where he gets his lunchbox can never cook meals as delicious. The arrangement continues and the two strangers start an unlikely relationship through notes they regularly exchange in the lunchbox. The notes gradually becoming more intimate. Soon, they are revealing slices of their seemingly hopeless lives to each other. The Lunchbox imagines its characters with warmth, adding a twist of wit to their dreary lives. Irrfan is perfect rendering a character far older than his actual age. He lets Fernandez evolve gradually from a grumpy old man to someone who finds hope in love, adding deadpan resilience to a miserable existence. Nimrat Kaur is captured interestingly in close-ups, the faint scar on her forehead almost symbolising Ila's silent pangs in a life that was meant to be beautiful. She is a big reason the film remains adorable. The narrative is enriched by a couple of other characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the goodnatured Aslam Sheikh, trainee who will take over from Fernandez, is a pleasant add-on. Sheikh plays a vital role in the transformation of Fernandez. But the really intriguing character in this film is of the auntyji upstairs. We never get to see her. She chats constantly with Ila through their kitchen windows as Ila is busy cooking lunch for her husband, often suggesting garnishing that could spice up the latter's marriage. Bharti Achrekar's is a class voice act as auntyji. Ritesh Batra's grasp of imagery belies the fact that he is a debutant, as Mumbai comes alive in its crowded locals, children playing cricket on the streets, rickshaws and ramshackle taxis. The imagining of the localities Fernandez and Ila reside in is quietly used to define their socio-cultural divide. Overall, the tone maintained never misses the point that The Lunchbox is essentially a love story. Send it to the Oscars? Why not. If the grudge against this film is it comes with little or no hype, at times the wrong train too can take you to the right station - as Nawazuddin's Aslam Sheikh spiritedly keeps saying all along.</Review>

One of the best films to come out of India in a long time, director Ritesh Batra answers the question in his little masterpiece, The Lunchbox. Ila (Nimrat Kaur) is in a loveless marriage, but lives in equanimity springing from ignorant bliss. Her rituals are hectic, identifiable. This is her life, a view restricted to her Malad East home's windows. She rushes against time to dress her daughter for school, waits for the dabbawala's cycle to show up, interacts with her neighbor (who we never see) across floors through a series of loud conversations, a basket on a pulley to facilitate the exchange of masalas, and a shared taste in music. Then there's her cooking. Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) is also a creature of habit, but crafted out of careful choices that may have crept up on him. In the last days before his retirement after 35 years of service in a government office, little has changed for the widower. An evening cigarette in his balcony overlooking the happy Christian family across at dinner, wearing the same track pants, always opening the top dabba of his lunchbox last. Always. It takes very little to shake up these seemingly unshakeable lives. A mis-delivered dabba, terse notes that are unwittingly humorous, harmless suggestions effecting a profound impact that create a beautiful mystery kindling - it's difficult to call it 'love' yet - an inexplicable intimacy. It also changes the way they interact with the world. Ila finally leaves the confines of her flat, she questions the futility of life and order. Fernandes blossoms as a human being, even affording his co-worker, Aslam Sheikh, a smile. Aslam's character (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) might seem an anomaly at first. All secondary characters mostly stay and transact off-screen. The camera usually stays on Ila or Fernandes, but Sheikh - the new recruit deputed to fill in Fernandes' shoes - is the exception. For one, his track bolsters the narrative and gives it a spark in the form of Siddiqui. And second, it firmly makes The Lunchbox about Fernandes. Batra's direction is impeccable and the final cut goes well beyond the screenplay. Tension builds, humor edges in, and drama unfolds in restrained measures. There isn't a single aspect you could change to better the experience. There is a sacrosanct approach in detailing the characters and the spaces they traverse. Frames are meticulously set up, without being ambitious at any point. His transitions are superb, simple. It's almost as if Batra wants you reach for the subtext by keeping the visuals uncomplicated. Despite the hundreds of films made in Bombay every year, there has hardly been one more true, more authentic to its city that The Lunchbox. But Batra's big achievement is modulating every performance to perfection. As it is, a director's greatest challenge is to continually keep actors aware of their graph and mood in the context of the script and each other. Now imagine doing this with a couple in entirely different locations yet communicating in synchronous pitch. To top it off, The Lunchbox has some twenty-odd producers, co-producers, and executive producers' name attached to it. From Danis Tanovic to Anurag Kashyap to Karan Johar, could a list be more diverse? This is how all films should be made. Support from across the board, with zero compromise on the director's vision. Is this really a first feature? Incredible. Irrfan Khan is in tremendous form, and delivers a fine, nuanced performance. He enjoys the freedom the indie format provides, taking his time, allowing space for the emotions to form into expressions that don't need support from dialogue or further exposition. The typical mainstream film would never have the patience for such a thing. Nimrat Kaur is excellent in her first release, an utterly unselfconscious effort. She barely has any face-to-face interactions, yet she commands the screen with confidence. And is it possible to not like Nawazuddin Siddiqui in any role he takes on, particularly an endearing one like Sheikh's? I watched The Lunchbox twice over a few months and can testify that it has a high repeat quotient, the final confirmation that was required for a perfect rating. There's buzz of an Oscar selection in the Best Foreign Language Film category. India will be hard-pressed to find a more deserving nominee.</Review>

No, sorry, scratch that; it is when a character narrates how and why he bought a painting.  It is a street-side purchase of a street-side scene: an artist at a scenic vantage point draws the same backdrop over and over again, but with varied details each time, his mental snapshot making each picture a wholly different capsule of captured time. It is here that Mr Fernandez spots a likeness of himself, as a part of the throng -- not that unlikely an occurrence, given that he has walked that stretch nearly every day for decades and decades. Usually a reticent man, he allows himself this rare moment of vanity and buys the painting. And then he tells -- or, indeed, confesses -- all of this to a stranger. There is so much to love here -- Mr Fernandez�s discovery; the uncharacteristic puffing up of his chest; the need to boast about what is not an accomplishment but feels certainly like a triumph -- that this short, beautiful tale of an accidental portrait could well turn into a film all its own. And yet in Ritesh Batra�s film, this is but a throwaway scrap of a very special conversation. The film assuredly glides past this gem instead of dwelling on it, and, in the process, enriches its own narrative. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how good The Lunchbox is, and how honest its storytelling rings. Ritesh Batra�s film -- about a city and serendipity -- might be about unremarkable folk, but it is a masterfully made and diligently restrained effort, one that impresses a viewer without impressing upon a viewer. It is a simple story with unanimous appeal, told with unshowy efficacy, and yet The Lunchbox is the most fascinating film to come out of Bombay in a very, very long time. In many ways -- not least because it is an astonishing directorial debut -- The Lunchbox is this generation�s Masoom. The Mumbai dabbawala is a miracle, a human cog with clockwork precision who operates, it seems, well outside Mumbai�s haphazard universe, and yet fuels the mercenaries shovelling coal into the city�s ever-open maw. The Lunchbox begins with a dabbawala getting it wrong, odds of which happen to be one in six million. But then this is a film about happenstance, a wondrous what-if movie that lifts us from realism to something far better, and it�s only fair that -- in ways unique to itself -- the city conspires, throughout the film, to set these events into motion, to champion this unlikely romance, to give us hope. For Mumbai has always motored along on magic. Thus, one fine afternoon, the city mistakes a widower for a husband and delivers him lunch. Lunch a wife laboured over, with much fondness and desperation, keen to surprise and amaze and seduce. The meal licked clean, the steel tiffin-box returns home atypically empty. And when the widower discovers that the neighbourhood eatery hasn�t suddenly upped its game, and the wife discovers her husband hasn't even missed her cooking, the two strike up a correspondence. The parallels with The Shop Around The Corner (and its cinematic granddaughter You�ve Got Mail) are obvious but unwarranted: the letters exchanged in The Lunchbox are less conversational, more confessional. He writes to her in English, writing initially for his own catharsis than any sense of communication, and she writes back in Hindi, giving away intimacies as if she thinks he might not understand the language that well. They are letters written with the kind of comfortable candour one finds in the neighbouring seat of an airplane, for example, candour that exists because the speakers aren�t likely to meet again and can thus speak their minds. In this film�s case, they never meet. Not that it gets in the way of their spirited romance. For that�s what this is, a film where Ila discovers cracks in her marriage and can mention them only to the stranger eating (and, indeed, critiquing) her cooking, and where the quiet Mr Fernandez -- with a first name that delightfully belies his reclusive nature -- rediscovers VHS-era laughter. There is much to smile at throughout this film as the two get to know each other and, in the process, tap into suppressed sides of themselves. All while Mumbai, impossible Mumbai, takes each of their individual soundtracks (hers from a neighbour�s cassette-player, his from kids on a train) and melds them together. Irrfan Khan plays Mr Fernandez with a superb placidity, a clock-obeying government employee who treasures silence. Khan clearly relishes the amount of internalisation the role allows him, and savours the quiet, thoughtful, melancholy beats of the film, unhurried but with his timing immaculate. He delivers his few lines with fantastic ease -- a deadpan gag about a blind man stands out -- but soaks up the silences even better: a scene where he reads a novel with one hand while eating his dinner with the other speaks, like this performance, volumes while keeping mum. A scene he stares up at an unmoving ceiling fan, with disbelief and a (momentarily justifiable) tinge of fear, is overwhelmingly good. Khan is a magnificent actor who keeps getting better, and this is him at his finest. Enchanting him is Nimrat Kaur whom we haven�t met before, but now, I daresay, shall be besotted with as a nation. Ila�s brow is frequently furrowed and her eyes wide, and Kaur pulls off the role of a wife with a world on her shoulders very impressively. It is a disarmingly natural performance that is impossible to forget and difficult to analyse, and in this limited space one may merely express admiration. There is a beautiful bemusement to most of her actions, as if she, initially can�t believe the world she has made for herself, and later can�t believe the world the letters are tugging her toward. She cooks like someone who genuinely loves it, with an effortless sensuality and a discernible joy in the more meticulous preparations. She�s excellent, and her character is strengthened by the terrific addition of an off-screen neighbour who lives above Ila�s flat and loves to help -- and to gloat. The always-great Bharati Achrekar is a treat as this invisible Aunty, and provides invaluable narrative thrust to a film that ambles along nice and slow. Similarly critical is Fernandez�s subordinate Aslam, a long-winded rookie the senior is supposed to show the ropes. Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays it relentlessly, bearing down on the taciturn Fernandez with irresistibly good-natured oafishness. He�s a mess, full of lies and insecurity and files smelling of the vegetables he chops on them during the train-ride back home, but in a film where the leads are quiet and cocoon their cards too close to their chests, Aslam is the one yanking the narrative with furious urgency, making things happen or, at the very least, talking about things happening. Batra, who has also written The Lunchbox, has allowed his smashing actors tremendous room to improvise, all the while himself sketching in nuanced details about the city, its food-ferriers, and the many disparities Mumbai is crammed with. It is a film of multiple pleasures -- small ones and overwhelming ones and exquisitely crafted ones -- layered one on top of the other, with something for everyone, and so, so much for the cinematic glutton.</Review>

Moreover, its masala mix is markedly understated. But no worries, it offers much that you can dig your teeth into. Pasanda is mentioned a couple of times and keema pav is alluded to on a solitary occasion. But, in keeping with the norm of Mumbai�s dabba delivery biz, neither finds its way into the diurnal meal at the centre of writer-director Ritesh Batra�s felicitous feature debut. It�s veggies all the way � okra, aubergine, cauliflower and apple gourd are the ingredients of choice. But the film�s mistress of spices, a neglected Malad housewife, works such magic with her ladle that she soon has a stranger, an enervated Bandra accountant, eating out of her hands. This quirky plot device hinges on a freak occurrence � a dabbawala delivers a lunchbox to the wrong address and sparks an unlikely romance. But nothing else in Batra�s remarkable film is fuelled by happenstance. It is a unique piece of cinema crafted with great dexterity and attention to detail. A strikingly original, idiosyncratic and charming love story, The Lunchbox dismantles the established structures of the genre in ways that are at once startling and effective. An immaculate screenplay provides the sturdy under-wiring on which Batra constructs his subtle drama about lonely souls in a teeming metropolis seeking to connect with each other across a vast divide. Besides the amazing quality of its craft, what props up The Lunchbox is a troika of splendid performances by Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The film is a compelling study of despair and loneliness on the one hand and unrequited love and unrealized dreams on the other. But it is also about loss and memory, and about missed opportunities and intimations of redemption. At its heart are emotionally fettered individuals grapple with their ingrained fears and doubts even as they seek solace in the little joys of life that could set them free. The Lunchbox is set in contemporary Mumbai, but Batra�s sharply delineated characters are enchantingly old world. They reach out to each other through scribbled notes in an era of electronic, mobile messages and social media. Ila (Nimrat Kaur), egged on by an elderly neighbour who we only hear but never see (voice of Bharti Achrekar), seeks to use her culinary skills to wrest the attention of her distracted husband, Rajiv (Nakul Vaid). The lunchbox she prepares reaches the wrong man. The recipient is a weary government employee, Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a widower on the verge of superannuation, a man who appears to have been shortchanged by fate. Realising by the evening that her lunchbox has gone amiss, Ila sends Saajan a note the next day, thanking him for doing justice to her dishes. The latter sends a reply dripping with characteristic coldness. But soon enough, the notes become longer, more intimate and unabashedly revelatory of their inner selves. Saajan rues the fact that he did not devote more time to his now-deceased wife and join her to watch her favourite Sunday morning television shows; Ila reveals that her hubby might be having an extra-marital affair. The character of the reticent, fastidious Saajan is contrasted with that of Dongri resident Aslam Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a garrulous and carefree understudy who has been brought in to replace the veteran. The latter, a hardened Mumbaikar, has learnt to take life�s blows on the chin. So, when Saajan wards off his repeated attempts to make friends with him, he perseveres until the senior gives in. What we see on the screen is bewitching; what we don�t is no less so. Even the absent or rarely seen characters cast their own, if only fleeting, spells. Yes, they all come alive for the audience: the comatose Mr Deshpande who spends all his waking hours staring at the ceiling fan in the apartment above Ila�s; Saajan�s unnamed wife who would record Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi episodes for repeated viewings; Shaikh�s non-existent ammi who strays into his cheerful conversations; Ila�s mother (Lillete Dubey) who has spent the last few years nursing an ailing husband; and of course, the worldly wise, ever helpful Deshpande auntie. Every �curry� that The Lunchbox rustles up is redolent of magic (both cinematic and culinary) of a transformative kind. It isn�t just the life of the male protagonist that it touches. It spills out of the screen and seeps deep into the viewer�s soul with the kind of all-encompassing force that is rarely encountered in a Mumbai film. Keenly observed rituals of daily existence in a metropolis provide substance to this simple, unpretentious, heart-warming tale. In essence, The Lunchbox is a nostalgic ode to the Mumbai of yore. It is peopled by characters that still yearn for Doordarshan�s early serials and sitcoms and the unalloyed sentimentality of 1980s and 1990s Hindi film songs. Besides Saajan�s drab and functional office space and Ila�s modest middle-class home, the film plays out in crowded trains and buses, and occasionally in auto-rickshaws. On their trips back and forth from their workplace, Saajan and Shaikh are hemmed in by fellow passengers, yet they always seem to stand apart from the crowd. They are both �outsiders� at odds with the big city and yet an essential part of it. Mishaps and miracles occur here every day and nothing represents the dynamics of Mumbai quite as eloquently as the 5000-odd dabbawalas who unfailingly feed millions of office-goers in the metropolitan maze. Batra captures that spirit with an unfailing and unsentimental eye, and gives the real-life dabbawalas and their songs a central place in the screenplay. The three central performances are terrific, with Irrfan and Nawazuddin striking up a duet that is absolutely spectacular. Nimrat Kaur is clearly a bundle of natural talent that Hindi cinema will do well do draw upon whenever a role demands more than just eye-candy appeal. Gorge into it and savour its lingering aftertaste. The Lunchbox holds riches that aren�t likely to be forgotten in a hurry.</Review>

It is the story of a suburban housewife, deeply alone. It is the story of meeting via eating. It is a love-story - and a love-letter to Mumbai, to trains that go dhak-dhak, to dabbawalas and rain, to love and life, sugar and spice, the despair and hope that mark every heart. Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan) is an accountant. His wife having died, the childless Saajan is a cold, prickly grouch avoided by all. One day, a lunchbox prepared by Ila (Nimrat) for her husband somehow reaches Saajan instead. He devours her delicacies, the empty box returned evidence of his enjoyment. Annoyed by the stranger's lack of thanks, Ila sends him another lunchbox with a sarcastic note - he responds. Suddenly, the two are writing daily, sharing jokes, fears, passions for keema and kadhi - then, a desire to meet. This movie is held together by delicate performances. Irrfan leads the way, underplayed, yet lasting, like a cardamom between your lips. With moments like Fernandes catching himself in a street painter's sketch, Irrfan shows an ordinary life with extraordinary deftness, resurrecting that childhood uncle, who, begged to return your ball, would snarl, "Do I look like your servant?" Irrfan is matched by Nimrat's Ila, soft as a sandesh, but with a mysterious, molten heart. Quiet moments, like Nimrat's expression when she smells the world on her husband's shirts, catch you. Ila's story, housewives living for husbands who switch off, is beautifully conveyed. The two are ably supported by chirpy, pesky Shaikh (Nawazuddin), Saajan's trainee, chopping vegetables on office files, melting the final barriers to Fernandes' frozen heart. Warming this feast is a wonderful screenplay - Bharti Achrekar, visible in voice as 'Aunty' - and sound recording that must be heard to be believed. As Fernandes eats Ila's lunches, every lick, every slurp, every little swallow comes through.

He shares his smoking habit through an incident on a letter he sends Ila (Nimran Kaur), a lonely housewife whose dabba which was meant for her neglecting husband goes wrongly to Saajan. She reverts with just an episode that of the death of her relative owing to cigarettes. No preaching, so sermons, nothing and yet it conveys a powerful message, he tries to kick the butt! 	Lunchbox Pictures   4 Pictures   	 Lunchbox Picture 	Lunchbox Picture 	Lunchbox Picture Lunchbox Picture Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox is a collection of such beautiful scenes that convey so much without so much as even passing a dialogue. The filmmaker takes Mumbai's famous Dabbawallahs as a vehicle to spin a romance that hasn't been witnessed in Hindi cinema for the longest time. In the day and age of SMSes, Facebook posts, Tweets and DMs, Batra weaves a romantic tale through letters that's far more realistic and impactful than any relationship of the make-up-break-up generation. The two haven't seen each other and yet become the closest confidants. Ila who finds a spark in her mundane life thanks to the unexpected error the Dabbawallah makes. The doting housewife who tries searching for her neglecting husband's love in the way he relishes her cooked meals soon chances upon a man who not only respects her but also savours every dabba that wrongly lands on his table. Saajan, a soon to retire officer is coming to terms with the fact that a young replacement Aslam (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) has to eventually take over. He is unwilling to let go, unwilling to face the emptiness of the days without a job and just then comes across a woman through the letters and her sumptuous cooking that he starts to adore. Statistically proven the meticulous Dabbawallahs of Mumbai do not err in their deliveries. The addresses are etched in their minds but Batra finds plausibility within such setting and does a commendable job. Not only does he bring out the romance in a hopeless place but also delves into the lives of many middle-class people that dream on to make it big in the Maximum City. The maker romanticizes even the hectic mundane activities of the local train or bus travel of the people, or the regular 9-5 jobs of even the little conversations between neighbours that strike a chord with you instantaneously. But if the maker showcases his potential in his debut film itself, the seasoned actors Irrfan Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui take it to another level with one of the best performances of their careers. Irrfan's straight-faced; dead-pan look with restrained performance breathes life into his character while Nawazuddin as the hearty and talkative colleague proves to a complete antithesis to Saajan Fernandes. Lesser known newbie Nimrat Kaur delivers an impressive performance as the middle-class wife staying in a small apartment in Malad East. Her body language to her appearance is all disarming. Bharti Achrekar's booming voice as ever helpful Aunty is endearing and makes you nostalgic reminding you of her popular show Waghle Ki Duniya. The Lunchbox to say the least is a rare gem wrapped carefully in a mundane tiffin-box. Ever thought the simplest of things in life could be so charming?</Review>

Now comes a film that tells the story of a gentle romance that blossoms in the swarming city of Mumbai between a young housewife and a middle-aged man. THE LUNCHBOX is a story of a beautiful relationship triggered by the wrong delivery of a lunchbox that's delivered daily within the bustling metropolis of Mumbai. A well-told old-fashioned romance, THE LUNCHBOX gracefully unknots the trials, tribulations, fears and hopes of everyday people sans the glamour that the city of Mumbai has become synonymous with. It also brings back memories of the days when people used to communicate through hand-written letters� and cell phones and emails were unheard of. Ila [Nimrat Kaur], a young housewife, tries to gain the attention of her husband [Nakul Vaid] via the paraphrased route 'the way to a man's heart is through his stomach'. However, despite her exquisite culinary skills and of course, the aid and constant prodding by a voice from the 'aunty' upstairs, Ila desolately fails. However, all's not lost as the meticulously cooked dabba lands on the table of an unknowing and seemingly normal Saajan [Irrfan Khan]. Later realizing the mistake when her husband returns home, Ila encloses a note for the new recipient. By this one-in-a-million mistake, the lives of two distinctly different individuals clash, leading to a romantic revival of familiarity through written correspondence in the age of emails. As the conversations between the two prolong, the topic shifts from the basic food to that of their lives, letting each individual open up more about themselves. As the film progresses, Ila, a confused housewife, emerges a more confident woman who is ready to take a decision. As for Saajan, he metamorphoses from a gloomy, close-to-retirement government employee to that of a man searching for his long-lost soul mate. Debutant director Ritesh Batra does a magnificent job of encapsulating the interminable restlessness of a city that is constantly on the go. While doing so, he expertly gives voice to the fears that constantly plague the minds of individuals though the exchange of hand-written letters, besides infusing that certain soul, warmth and compassion in the narrative. He also deserves kudos for choosing an unconventional plot, combining romance and food that's sure to strike a chord with cineastes. In fact, it won't be erroneous to state that the film's strength lies in its simplistic plot and an unfussy screenplay, besides the striking performances of its principal actors. Irrfan illustrates yet again that he's one of the finest talents to come out of India. Just recall his body of work and you'd agree that he's a volcano of talent that leaves you completely enthralled with noteworthy performances in film after film. The question is, is there something Irrfan can't do? Nimrat is the find of the year, truly. To stand up to talents like Irrfan and Nawazuddin in a film and yet retain your individualistic identity is nothing short of an accomplishment. Nawazuddin is absolutely flawless, essaying his part with flair. Denzil Smith, Bharti Achrekar [never seen but heard in the film], Nakul Vaid and Lillette Dubey add spice to their respective parts. On the whole, THE LUNCHBOX is a standout film, a sumptuous treat that's sure to be relished by connoisseurs of cinema. A film with a big heart, it makes you realize that you can unearth contentment and pleasure even if you board the wrong train. Easily one of the finest films to come out of India.</Review>

Shahid Kapoor stars as Vishwas Rao, a small-town fella who's grown up nursing dreams of becoming a movie star. However, his autorickshaw-driver mum (Padmini Kolhapure) wants him to be an honest police officer instead. On the pretext of seeking admission in a police academy, Vishwaas moves to Mumbai and pursues his acting ambitions. But then he's mistaken for a cop by an over-zealous social worker (a screechy Ileana D'cruz), and he's forced to play along when his mum decides to visit. Shahid Kapoor, in very good form, delivers laughs fast and frequent, displaying an as-yet-unseen flair for physical comedy. He's terrific in a scene where he shows up for recruitment in the police force, pretending to suffer from multiple birth ailments. I also particularly enjoyed a scene in which he loses his cool with a film director who turns him away coldly. There are some interesting characters too, like Saurabh Shukla's Gundappa, a don who misses the good ol' days when you could pay off cops and rest assured that they'd protect you. Sanjay Mishra gets some good lines as Jogi, an unsuccessful scriptwriter and patron saint of struggling actors. But writer-director Rajkumar Santoshi fails to stick with this cheerfully harebrained tone in the film's second half, going instead for a sappy maa-beta emotional conflict, and a clunky subplot involving a mysterious villain who plans to blow up the city using biochemical bombs. The twists are predictable here, the climatic action scene recycled from Santoshi's own Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, and even the ambition-throttling message of this movie is questionable. Look out for a scene-stealing cameo by Salman Khan, who mentions Santoshi's Andaz Apna Apna which he'd starred in. This film has its moments, but it's light years away from that gem. I'm going with two out of five for 'Phata Poster Nikhla Hero'. It loses steam at the halfway mark when the laughs suddenly dry up.</Review>

There's an infectious spirit of fun in the lyrics and the choreography, and in the way the hero plays a little silly, a little mad. And you hope that this spirit will colour the rest of the film, about a fellow who wants to be a film hero, and whose mother wants him to be a cop. Alas, that doesn't happen. On this one-liner of a plot, Rajkumar Santoshi has built a two-and-a-half-hour film which is meant to make us laugh, but ends up making us groan instead. Actually, you begin wincing right from when a standard Bollywood mother is presented to us in the shape of Padmini Kolhapure. She lectures her little boy Vishwas Rao (Kapoor) on the virtues of doing the right thing, with deathly seriousness. Now if Santoshi wanted to send up standard Bollywood tropes like the maaaa, and the good hero, and the bad guy, which is what he seems to want to, Kolhapure strikes the wrong note. Where is the nudge and the wink? And that is what happens right through this tedious tale, which drags on with little relief. The characters are all caricatures in the dullest, stodgiest way possible. Kajal (D'Cruz),the ditzy heroine is pretty and vacuous. Saurabh Shukla is a rotund bad guy who looks as if he is up for the laughs, but is ill-used. Darshan Jariwala plays a cop and is seen to be trying very hard. The end, which involves a jokey villain, a "gas" bomb, bumbling cops and robbers, along with the rest of the cast, is properly preposterous. Why couldn't this have been the tone throughout? Kapoor, who's had a recent run of bad films, does everything he can. Dancing, romancing, fighting. He even shows he is learning to laugh at himself. At one point, there's a reference to Andaz Apna Apna, the riotous Santoshi comedy, which makes me roll on the floor every time I watch it. Salman Khan shows up for a scene, steals it, and the movie. 'Andaz Apna Apna' showed how Santoshi could do it. Any chances of an encore?</Review>

Rajkumar Santoshi tries to put an original spin on the South-Indian film remake formula that Bollywood is besieged by. He attempts to mock it by getting rid of all "serious" elements and keeping it firmly in the comic zone. Unfortunately, it stops being funny after a while. The film opens with an 80's-style prologue where a starry-eyed kid who wants to be a film hero is raised by a mother who intends for him to become an honest police officer. It's been maybe a decade or more since we last saw a film driven by a mother-son relationship at its center (these days we seem to be hung up on heroes with complex daddy issues) complete with melodrama including hospitalization, threats of self-poisoning, and absolute redemption. Is it fun or innovative? No. Does it evoke nostalgia? Maybe a little. The story is ridiculous with the plot hinging on monumental coincidences and songs patched in between scenes there was no way to connect. At one point while his mother is dying, the hero is dancing (with utter conviction) in an item with Nargis Fakhri as she croons "Main chidiya firangi, tu desi mosambi". The love track between Shahid Kapoor and Ileana d'Cruz is merely a footnote that relies heavily in dreamed-up song sequences. At a key juncture, the mother comes visiting from the village to check up on her son's progress as a police officer. He is forced to, in turn, replicate the situation from Munnabhai MBBS where he must act as one. They pass it off as a joke in PPNH, but underlining the source in your dialogue, doesn't give you the license to rip off the idea for a large chunk of your film. There are good bits too, though they're almost all in the first half. The depiction of the police - Darshan Jariwala, Zakir Hussain, etc. is rather fun. But Santoshi gets ambitious in the second half and contrives an end involving biological weapons and countdown timers and eventually goes into another zone from where there's no turning back. If only he'd maintained the tone and accessibility from the start, we'd have a stronger film. Shahid Kapoor turns up with a high energy, much improvised performance that fits perfectly for this particular movie. He seems to have had a blast because, really, anything goes. PPNH is the kind of film where a gun is pointed at him and he breaks out into a hilarious dance before going on to beat up the baddies. Could an actor have more fun? Then there's Padmini Kolhapure who has a larger, more significant role than the heroine d'Cruz and well, when your template is the 70's Bollywood's ubiquitous, 'Ma' - there's not much to effort to put in. Essentially a gimmicky two-star film that entertains in bits, a half star extra for Salman Khan's epic, self-deprecating cameo.</Review>

The talented actor is neither an underdog nor top dog, too experienced to be treated as a newcomer but not successful enough to pose a serious threat to his rivals. Life influences art and emerges as a new myth in Phata Poster Nikhla Hero, which makes the strongest possible case yet to the movie trade and viewers that Kapoor cannot be written off easily. Rajkumar Santoshi�s cartoonish comedy, about a small-town boy who wants to be a movie star, throws the actor a lifeline that he grabs with hands and feet. Kapoor hams, fights, weeps, frowns, sings, dances (beautifully) and woos without breaking into a sweat�a masterful act of professionalism from a gifted but allegedly mercurial actor. Kapoor�s tender and innocent screen image is perfectly suited to carry off the antics of the movie-mad Vishwas, who pretends to be a policeman in order to fulfil his mother Savitri�s dream. Vishwas inadvertently becomes a heroic police officer, watched on with adoration by Ileana D�Cruz�s Kajal, but runs afoul the buffoonish villain Gundappa (Saurabh Shukla). It�s very loud and overlong (2 hours, 26 minutes), sometimes funny and often tedious. Phata Poster... is bursting with insider jokes (Salman Khan sends himself up, Vishwas auditions for a role) and references to Santoshi�s back catalogue (Andaz Apna Apna; Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani), borrowings from slapstick Hollywood comedies, slow-motion action sequences, several songs and the mandatory worship of the Indian screen mother. The tone is uneven, with sudden detours into pathos, the humour is mostly childish and always accompanied by sound effects, and the enthusiastic hamming is ultimately exhausting. Santoshi is notorious for over-egging his confections, but to the credit of his enthusiastic leading man and the rest of the cast, including Padmini Kolhapure as Vishwas�s mother, Darshan Jariwala as a senior policeman, and Sanjay Mishra as Vishwas�s mentor, they put on their best collective funny face and follow instructions admirably.</Review>

He flies into the scene. He bashes up a gang of goons. And he doesn�t even break into a sweat. Over the top and completely ridiculous is Phata Poster Nikhla Hero (PPNH). Nothing wrong in having a film that�s not too serious. But even parodies need a story. It doesn�t help when the story runs its course in 20 minutes. The film though stretches its premise with many a gag to two-and-a-half hours. The songs jump into the narrative like special appearances. And Rajkumar Santoshi, it seems, has made a film for an audience that�s incapable of maintaining any kind of focus. Unless you have zero attention span, you can�t miss the gross disconnect between what Shahid Kapoor does in PPNH and what his director is trying to do. The lead man sees a chance to impress a section of viewers who enjoy air-borne action and campy humour. So he throws the kitchen sink in his attempt to be comic. And he dances like a dream. He fights just as good too. He�s the sole reason you can sit through this movie. But Santoshi, on the other hand, can�t seem to move out of the Andaz Apna Apna (AAA) template. AAA was a classic. We all know it. But how many times can the same gags makes us laugh? Irony is Salman Khan makes a special appearance in PPNH. A few seconds of his improvised humour are far more amusing than the entire film. Shahid Kapoor plays Vishwas who dreams of being a movie hero. But his mother wants him to be a police officer. Vishwas gets an interview call from the Mumbai police. But when he arrives in Mumbai he dedicates all his energies to becoming an actor. The premise could have been explored with so many more possibilities. But that doesn�t happen. The story is relegated to �70s style lost and found theme. And by the end the hero, heroine, bad guys and extras are all out to save the world from a terrorist attack. You can�t update 40-year-old filmmaking formulas by adding a modern bio-weapon terrorism plot. Even the quirky bad guys are wasted here. You have Saurabh Shukla playing a mellow don, Zakir Hussain portraying a corrupt but foolish cop and a mysterious crime lord who oversees all the villainy. The boss� name is Napolean, he has a husky voice and he never reveals his face to the camera. But no. All of that comedic promise is wasted in a climax where everyone�s shuffling on a switch that will blow up bombs. How many times have we seen that before? The highlight of the first half of PPNH is the chemistry between Shahid and Ileana D�Cruz. Here you have two good-looking actors complimenting each other perfectly. Their comic timing together is impeccable. But there�s nothing for them to do beyond the frivolous comedy of errors. The sentimental mother and the �I�ll do my own thing� son track between Padmini Kolhapure and Shahid doesn�t work either. PPNH could have been funny. Shahid gives physical comedy and high-flying action his best shot. But at the end this movie just seems like a sorry rehash of what the director has done before.</Review>

Both are so spectacularly bad that it would be best to give them a wide berth. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero is the kind of dim-witted comedy that might leave the hardiest of Bollywood junkies in tears. The agony of being subjected to this tattered bag of stale tricks can indeed be excruciating, when it is not outright numbing. A village boy aspires to be a movie star. But his doting mother wants him to join the police force and work for the weak and defenceless. So the guy heads to Mumbai and slips into the guise of a crime-buster although acting is the only thing he has on his mind. The hero quickly runs into all sorts of trouble and so does the film. The gags lack punch and the situations border on the imbecile. The weak screenplay, hanging from a feeble make-believe thread, is as utterly unconvincing as the fake cop that it revolves around. This young man has no qualms about taking on the hoodlums in town but is mindful of the need to save his mug from injury. My face, he says, is my fortune. If only he had a brain to boot. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero strives very hard to be funny, but director Raj Kumar Santoshi's script is so hugely lame that this scrappy comedy of errors takes next to no time to turn into a tiresome tragedy of terrors. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero opens in what looks like a cross between a hamlet and mofussil town, where a woman named Savitri (Padmini Kolhapure) drives an auto-rickshaw for a living. Her only son, Vishwas Rao (Shahid Kapoor), a fanatical admirer of Salman Khan, wants to follow in his idol's footsteps. But when he lands in Mumbai for a recruitment test, he is mistaken for an intrepid police officer by an over-zealous social worker, Kaajal (Ileana D'Cruz). Vishwas, with the help of a bunch of fellow movie industry strugglers led by a small-time scriptwriter Jogi Bhai (Sanjay Mishra), plays along so as not to disappoint his mom. In the bargain, he antagonizes a criminal Gundappa Das (Saurabh Shukla) and a crooked cop Ghorpade (Zakir Hussain). The rigmarole gets even more bizarre when Vishwas' mother decides to visit him and the Joint Commissioner of Police Khare (Darshan Jariwala) moves into the ground floor of the two-storey building that the hero resides in. If all this is meant to be amusing, the joke is always on film and the characters that people its narrative world. Andaz Apna Apna is history. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero is not even Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. Santoshi, clearly not in his elements, leaves no stone unturned to reduce an array of capable character actors into insufferable hams who rave and rant their way through this mindless melee in order to be heard above the din. Saddled with a poorly written role, Shahid Kapoor can only struggle to make an impression. The effort is completely wasted. Ileana D'Cruz is infinitely worse off. Playing a crusader who believes in keeping the police on their toes but seems to have no idea what she is driving at, she is compelled to sleepwalk through her role. It is difficult to fathom why Padmini Kolhapure would have agreed to come out of semi-retirement to play the mother in a plot designed to smother any possibilities that the sketchy character might have had. Stay away from this film if you value your time and money. And if you still insist on giving it a shot, do remember that there is no refund on the ticket. That is what you will be asking for well before the joke winds up.</Review>

First, his own starry dreams (ruled by Rajnikanths and Khans) of being a Bollywood superstar. Second, his high-on-melodrama maa's (Padmini) long cherished dream - "mera beta police afsar banega". But fate takes a hilarious twist when he's mistaken for a good cop (Thank Heavens, he has Chulbul Pandey for inspiration. With tighties, googles, dabanggisms, and his own sizzling 'Munni'). He falls in love with the over-zealous Kajal (Ileana), a social worker with many chaotic-causes. Soon he's caught in chor-police crossfire between the dreadfully funny gangster Gundappa Das (Saurabh Shukla) and the asli good cop (Darshan Jariwala) - both put up rip-roaring acts. In a comedy of errors and events, through heartbreak and hilarity, emotion and eccentricity, Vishwas flips between fake herogiri and asli heroism. Shahid is 'phaadu', really! Whether he's doing the dhating naach (outstanding); playing rowdy Romeo, a goofy goon, or maa ka laadla; he's back in form and packs in all with terrific chutzpah and comic flair. He makes the most of every 'emoticon' there is and leaves you 'ROTFL'. This one belongs to Kapoor and he revels in it. Ileana is good at emotions, but not so tuned into comedy yet. Padmini, the melancholic maa with tons of mascara plays the part with ease, though we wish she induced more laughs over tear-jerking 'maa-kasam' dialogues. Sanjay Mishra, as Vishwas' Bollywood advisor is uproariously funny. Santoshi shows flashes of his previous 'Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani', odes to his own classics ('Andaz Apna Apna', 'Ghayal') and of course the ultimate fan-boy moment when Vishwas meets his screen idol Salman (the asli hero!). The first half offers loads of cackles, chuckles, witticisms and spoofy scenes. Post-interval the comedy collapses for a bit with forced OTT drama, khaali-peeli action, and too many songs breaks, but makes a comeback with delightfully funny moments. This one's worth it for the 'howlarity' of it all. And Shahid in his element. 'Vishwas' nahin hota? ...Go watch! (LOL! Maa Kasam, it's just the comedy hangover!) Note: You may not like this film if you don't have a taste for silly humour &amp; mindless gags!</Review>

So much so that even the story writers are incessantly wracking their brains over what more can be dug out of a mere cop drama. And filmmaker Rajkumar Santoshi concocts that very innovative twist that one needed with Phata Poster Nikhla Hero (PPNH). But does it work? We tell you... Vishwas Rao (Shahid Kapoor) dreams of being a superstar while his mother (Padmini Kolhapure), a rickshaw driver, wants him to be a cop. He moves to Mumbai to pursue his dream, lying to her that he is going for the training for becoming a police inspector but circumstances push to act up as a fake cop instead. How he gets embroiled into acting like a cop even though he is not, incident after incident is what follows through a series of humorous episodes. Comedy king Rajkumar Santoshi who last made the roaring success Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani in 2009 comes back with a very interesting concept of role reversal from real to reel to reel to real and surprisingly also puts together enjoyable twists and turns but sadly, just when you think it gets better the film takes a sharp accidental turn and you start wondering if the filmmaker got struck by a hammer on head and caught amnesia to forget what actually he went out to make. Right from the promos to the loud "set"- tish backdrops to even the fonts that Santoshi uses in PPNH remind you clearly of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani and while the first half turns out to be quite entertaining courtesy humorous gags complemented well by decent performances, the second slips conveniently into the cliched zone, that too of the '80s and follows it up with a highly Ajab Ghazab-isq climax. So you have the melodramatic mother-son angle, the reunion of father-son separated for eons, the sudden change of hearts and more, clearly out of the '80s over-dramatic movies that bore you to death and make you wish the feel reel would just face a catastrophic accident and get burnt on the rest of the run time. Sadly, it doesn't and you are all but left to watch the cliched tamasha just go on from plain insipid to pure lunatic. What's worse, there are innumerous songs spurting within scenes, out of focus shots and jump cuts that really put a question on the makers command over edit and production quality. Shahid Kapoor who last appeared in the lackluster Teri Meri Kahaani comes back strong and really works on his acting. His efforts can be seen as he pulls off a range of emotions right from serious to dramatic to even comic. His lead actress Ileana D'Cruz who last appeared in Barfi plays a social worker in the film and Shahid's love interest. A superstar from South, Ileana appears comfortable and in her zone in this potboiler for her experience of South masala capers comes to fore here. Padmini Kolhapure as the over melodramatic mother within her space tries really hard to stay true to her character but it's the faulty character-sketch that makes her act appear annoying. Sanjay Mishra as Vishwas' Guru, Darshan Jariwala as ACP Khare, Mukesh Tiwari as the separated father turned baddie Napolean and Saurabh Shukla as Gundappa are all made to ham to extremes in a bid to bring out some humour but sadly it all falls flat. Two highlights of the film that make the film a worthy watch are Salman Khan's cameo and Shahid Kapoor's sequence when he has to showcase his acting skills by playing a baddie. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero in short has funny elements but very few and far in between. The rest of the film is plain head-breaking bore.</Review>

From the looks of it, PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO falls into the same genre as the latter, while the motive is crystal clear: to offer infinite hilarity in those 2+ hours. The question is, will Taurani and Santoshi experience triumph yet again? With a catchy title, promos that emit accurate signals to its target audience and a genre that's the flavor of the season, will PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO have a heroic run at the ticket window? Santoshi has proved his versatility ever since he made his debut film. Though he tasted big success in varied genres, you can't overlook the fact that films like ANDAZ APNA APNA and AJAB PREM KI GHAZAB KAHANI not only won hearts and brought smiles on our faces, but also have tremendous recall value to this date. PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO too abounds in clean, inane humor that will have you rolling with laughter. One of the prime reasons why PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO also works is the superlative performance by Shahid Kapoor, who goes all massy with this one. More on that later� PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO narrates the story of Vishwas Rao [Shahid Kapoor], an aspiring actor, who aims to make it big in Bollywood. However, a chance encounter with Kajal [Ileana D'Cruz] and Vishwas, who is dressed up as a cop, is mistaken to be a cop in real life. What ensues is a series of crazy escapades which turns Vishwas' life upside down. Let's get this straight! There's nothing in PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO that you haven't watched before. It has a standard theme, several clich�s that you may have encountered in earlier films, but what works is the fact that the journey to the destination is full of amusement and entertainment. Although Santoshi has helmed comedies earlier, the humor in PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO is more unabashed, in your face, goofier and physical. The sole similarity between Santoshi's earlier works and this one is that the wit and humor is just hard to disregard. You can't help but break into a smile or guffaw at the most absurd, ludicrous situations, which is what the intent is. PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO brings back memories of old-fashioned comic entertainers. There's not much of a plot here, but you go with the flow without making much effort. You laugh, celebrate the silly gags and by the time the story reaches its conclusion, you realize that the film has won you over with its unfussy plot and basic characters, who don't have a serious bone in their body. It's a frothy comedy that would have gone astray and misplaced its luster had it been delegated to a lesser talent. The lone hiccup is the villain's sub-plot in the second hour. The portions involving him and Operation White Elephant could've been integrated far more persuasively in the scheme of things. Besides, a song, reminiscent to the one in AJAB PREM KI GHAZAB KAHANI, could've easily been avoided. Additionally, a few jokes and jibes in this hour lack the wittiness of the first half. With Tips producing the film, one expects the soundtrack of PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO to be top notch and Pritam lives up to the expectations. The stylish and high-on-energy choreography only garnishes the tracks further. 'Tu Mere Agal Bagal Hain' is easily the best track, followed by 'Dhating Naach'. In fact, Shahid's dance in the latter is simply jaw-dropping. I'd like to make a special mention of the witty dialogue, which bring a smile on your face persistently. PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO belongs to Shahid Kapoor absolutely. Completely. He nails it and how. No two opinions on that. He gets to portray the part of an entertainer, a character which is *not* everyone's cup of tea, but Shahid makes sure he carries off the part with amazing ease, displaying his funny side in several sequences. What's noteworthy is that he's pitted with [accomplished] actors known for their comic timing [Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Mishra, Darshan Jariwala], yet Shahid proves that he's a complete natural in this genre. Slapstick, dance, action, romance -- he seems to be enjoying it all here. For Ileana, who made her Hindi film debut with BARFI!, a film like PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO gives her the podium to play the conventional heroine. She lends a lot of grace to her character and the pairing with Shahid looks fresh and charming. It's a treat to watch Padmini Kolhapure on the big screen after a hiatus. She's wonderful. Saurabh Shukla is in terrific form. He's so so so funny. Sanjay Mishra has an impeccable comic timing and he proves it yet again. He's fab. Darshan Jariwala gets it right, stressing on the fact that he can handle comedy with equal flourish. Zakir Hussain is first-rate. Again, a welcome change from the negative roles he has been asked to portray in film after film. Mukesh Tiwari is efficient. Rana Jung Bahadur and Navin Prabhakar lend decent support. Salman Khan sparkles in a cameo. He is sure to bring the house down with his poker-face act. Nargis Fakhri sizzles in the dance number, matching steps with Shahid. On the whole, PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO is an entertainer all the way. If you relished AJAB PREM KI GHAZAB KAHANI from the team of Taurani and Santoshi, chances are you will also lap up this vibrant, kaleidoscopic, light-hearted entertainer.</Review>

It's not enough to merely sit there in your seat and 'watch' the film, but to listen attentively to its characters and consider their arguments. If you're willing to make that investment, you'll be rewarded with a richly emotional, intellectual, and sensory experience. The film follows three separate stories that raise pertinent questions about identity, death, and morality. In the first, we're introduced to Aliya (Aida El-Kashef), a blind photographer who uses intuition to capture brilliant black-and-white images. A cornea transplant restores her vision, but she fears she may have lost her inspiration. In the second and most affecting story, we meet Maitreya (Neeraj Kabi), a Jain monk and staunch animal-rights activist, who is diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and must consider a transplant. On discovering that the medication that could save his life might have been tested on animals, he refuses treatment. The third story is centered on Naveen (Sohum Shah), a stockbroker and the recent recipient of a donated kidney. He becomes obsessed with bringing justice to a poor man he meets, whose kidney was illegally stolen during an appendix surgery. These three strands interconnect satisfyingly in a moving climax, and tie in neatly with the overarching philosophical idea thrown up by the film's title: Does a ship, whose every part has been replaced piece by piece, remain the same ship in the end? Gandhi applies this paradox skillfully to the human body, asking if a person who has had an organ transplant is still the same person he previously was. Giving us a nice lived-in feel of each of their worlds, Gandhi takes us inside the minds of our three protagonists, showing us what they stand for, and how they've changed over the course of the journey they undertake during the film. Each of our protagonists engages in intelligent, thought-provoking arguments, and it's hard not to come away deeply affected by some of the issues raised. The verbal sparring between the monk and a young lawyer-in-training is particularly engaging, and full of insightful gems worth considering. Languidly paced and lushly filmed, 'Ship of Theseus' is just as rich cinematically, and benefits from terrific performances by each of the protagonists, particularly Kabi whose physical transformation as the ailing monk is a sight to behold. Gandhi gives us a fine supporting cast too, who occasionally infuse humor in a film that otherwise stings from its brutal honesty. I'm going with four and a half out of five for 'Ship of Theseus'. It stimulates the one organ that popular Hindi cinema consistently ignores - the brain! Give it a chance and prepare to be dazzled.</Review>

Ship of Theseus is that rare sensory experience, which reaches out with its sublime sights, surreal sound and spiritual scent. Writer-Director Anand Gandhi explores the profound stretch between philosophy and science, temporary and infinite, part and whole to address the irony and duplexity of identity, ideology and ethics through the famous Theseus's paradox. The riddle-like conundrum it poses is: if all its old parts were replaced by new ones would it still remain the same ship? And if all those discarded parts were assembled together would that then qualify as the original Ship of Theseus? Creating a transcendent environment through its three largely independent stories, with only a running theme of organ transplant in common, Gandhi introduces us to its three key protagonists in turns before arriving to its glorious, masterstroke finale. There's the extraordinarily lucent and intuitive Aida Elkashef as Aaliya, a visually-challenged Egyptian photographer with a gift for sensing photo opportunities in the most concealed areas. She doesn't mind losing the details in her compelling monochrome compositions and commands complete authority over her art as emphasised over heated arguments with her live-in boyfriend. After regaining her eyesight, following a cornea transparent surgery, however, Aaliya begins to doubt her mastery over her craft. In the second plot line, the focus shifts on Maitreya, a learned monk (Neeraj Kabi) belonging to a fictional sect and his legal endeavours to stop the mistreatment of animals in laboratories for testing and research. (Gandhi provides disturbing proof to highlight this cruelty with clinical composure.) But when he's diagnosed with a life threatening disease, wherein the treatment threatens his ideals, Maitreya's will-power is tested like never before. And finally there's a money-minded stockbroker Navin, played by co-producer Sohum Shah, who's recently received a kidney transplant and discovers a sense of social responsibility by tracing a case of illegal transplant all the way to Sweden. Though primarily set in Mumbai, Ship of Theseus converses in English, Arabic, Hindi and Swedish through its deftly-penned script by Gandhi, where language changes its tone and texture according to given setting with remarkable fluency. He sets his ambitious ideas on soul recycling around people we know or pass by, exchanges we've heard and participated in, around places we belong or are acquainted with but seldom, or perhaps never, visit on big screen. Visibly knowledgeable and fervid-viewed in spheres of philosophy and science, Gandhi contains any urge, if at all, to be didactic or impose his beliefs. Sure, he constructs all three key protagonists as cultivated souls within the parameters of their backdrops. Sure, they engage in meaningful debates over ideology and the need for empathy towards society, environment and aesthetics. But, realisation, comes at its own pace, price and accord. With serious intelligence comes sparkling clarity and Gandhi has it in abundance resulting in a lucid, genuine film that doesn't alienate but draws in its awed viewer. Equally commendable is the 32-year-old filmmaker's pristinely original vision. Whether it's the unique, undiscovered locations he's picked to shoot in a city one foolishly believes has nothing new to offer or presenting the same old landmarks with a refreshing perspective, Gandhi recovers some of the long-lost Bombay (not Mumbai) in Ship of Theseus. There's lots to appreciate about his cast of inspiring actors and friends who pitched in. Shah conveys a world in his contemplative pauses. He doesn't have any hard-hitting lines. He doesn't need any. Amba Sanyal, as his grandmother, provides this well-rounded story with its impulses while Sameer Khurana, as his buddy lends SOT some rare occasions to chuckle. Elkashef impresses with her unbridled spontaneity and expressiveness. But it's Neeraj Kabi's mild-mannered but sharp wit (when he indulges young intern Charvaka (an earnest Vinay Shukla), staggering physical transformation and a performance that demonstrates such intrinsic connection/commitment towards the principles he's striving for that truly stands out as the best in this film and among the best this year. And there's Pankaj Kumar's dazzling camerawork, shot on a Canon EOS-1D Mark IV, which is as alive and probing as the questions put forth by SOT. There's no filtering to differentiate one story from the other except the shift of seasons -- winter, monsoon and summer and changing geography -- dingy lanes and cozy neighbourhood of Mumbai, majestic vistas of Himachal Pradesh and the stunning but secluded spots of Stockholm even as the soft-pedalled score lends in a mild, meditative ambiance. Ship of Theseus is a sign of evolution in filmmaking, a work of art. I cannot award such artistry with mere stars. I can only hope it's a precedent not an exception and wish you go and watch it.</Review>

Anand Gandhi�s Ship of Theseus is a frightening film. One of the three stories in the film is about a Jain monk who, for most of his life, has been crusading against pharmaceutical experiments that brutalize animals. He is battling a failing liver, and has vowed not to accept prescription pills or an organ transplant. We see him reach a moment when, foreseeing death, he asks for his mother. His body is lacerating and feeble, and his face, scrutinized closely by Gandhi and his cinematographer Pankaj Kumar, is rupturing with fear. His idealism is reeling and capsizing. He might also just ask for the doctor. Already hugely feted by critics, Gandhi�s film has plenty of didacticism. He uses the screenplay as a vehicle for philosophical ideas and most of the scenes are arguments about the nature of the body, soul and extreme idealism. We see characters living, breathing, and also compulsively arguing with each other. Gandhi explains the Theseus paradox, a Greek myth, before the film begins: When all the parts of a ship are replaced by new parts, does it remain the ship it once was? photo The director is almost trying to be a myth maker here, a put-off for lovers of the medium if he is not committed to meeting the challenges unique to the art form. Terrence Malick is the inventor and supreme practitioner of this subgenre. Despite the hyper-articulate philosophizing, Gandhi�s film is stirring because he is deeply committed to making a good, competent film. The camera moves with the pace of characters and the canvas�at a Mumbai street intersection it is frenetically mobile, the background sound a cacophony; on a journey of a group of monks across a road lined by windmills, it is quiet and languorous. Intimate scenes with only natural sounds in the background follow scenes of unexpected grandeur. The editing is crisp and the performances are terrific. All the three lead characters are new to the big screen in India. Neeraj Kabi, a theatre actor, is a revelation as the monk. The dialogues are razor-sharp and lifelike, the reason why the pomposity of their ideological stances is acceptable, as are the settings�a sparse monastery, rain-lashed Mumbai roads, the undramatic proceedings of a high court, a balcony overlooking lit-up matchbox apartments josting each other. Gandhi, who has written the film, treats his characters with severity and affection, and the actors live up to the big task at hand. The film�s three stories are united by the theme of organ donation. Aliya (Aida Elkashef) is an Egyptian artist in Mumbai for an eye transplant. She absorbs the city by taking photographs. A curious lawyer, Charwaka (Vinay Shukla), engages with Maitreya, the Jain monk in zealous pursuit of a world free of cruelty towards animals. Reminiscent of Mahatma Gandhi in his austerity and obstinately living an ideal, Maitreya is the film�s most memorable character, placed in an Aristotelian dialectic with the precocious young lawyer. Navin (Sohum Shah), a stockbroker who has, after having undergone a kidney transplant, gone to Stockholm looking for a man who has stolen someone�s kidney. In a stunning, emotionally profound climax, there is a screening of a documentary filmed inside an ancient cave of shimmering rock. photo Aida Elkashef in a still Ship of Theseus is a passionate and clever film, brimming with sharp and original interpretations of age-old philosophy. American critic Pauline Kael described, in one of her essays, how taste for trash eventually inculcates taste for art. �One�s moviegoing tastes and habits change�I still like in movies what I always liked but now, for example, I really want documentaries. After all the years of stale-stupid acted-out stories, with less and less for me in them, I am desperate to know something, desperate for facts, for information, for faces of non-actors and for knowledge of how people live�for revelations, not for the little bits of show-business detail worked up for us by show-business minds who got them from the same movies we�re tired of.� I feel ditto, perhaps one of the reasons I support Ship of Theseus with all my heart and am waiting for Gandhi�s second film.</Review>

Despite its ambiguous sound and allegorical references, The Ship of Theseus is an exercise in trying to create opinion, raise a platform for debate, or simply narrate a story. Three separate stories and three different voices despite their diversity speak in unison as they address the topic of organ donation. We meet Aliya (Aida El-Kashef), a visually impaired photographer whose words are as razor sharp and unflinching as her black and whites. After a successful cornea grafting operation, her eyesight is restored but her photos don�t come out as they did before. Blindfolded sitting in her apartment she wonders if creative stagnation is the price she would pay for her new found vision.  Maitreya( Neeraj Kabi) is a spiritual guru on a quest to stop unethical practice of animal testing in laboratories. While saving lives, he is cornered with a life threatening condition that requires a liver transplant. There begins an outward and inward struggle to make a decision, whether to adhere to the principles he vehemently preaches or to give in to the temptation of letting his soul stay in the physical form a bit longer. The final chapter is of Naveen, a stockbroker who decides to expose the dark underbelly of organ smuggling after going through a transplant himself. What�s hot SOT is a film that challenges your existing beliefs about everything � religion, the food you eat, the water you drink, your relationship with parents, friends, it subconsciously lets loose a series of stream of thoughts that run through your mind. Anand Gandhi scores in making each of these characters seem real. Nothing seems rehearsed, scripted or gimmicky. There is certain calmness and a sense of maturity in his handling these different stories. Dialogues are often opinionated, heavy and terse, but  given the nature of the  issues they address. Performances are exemplary. Despite being three different entities, the ensemble has a cohesive appeal that works remarkably.  There is no disintegration or abruptness to the shift from one story to another. Cinematographer Pankaj Kumar�s frames are brilliant. He captures the by lanes of Mumbai with the same passion and integrity as he plays with the snow capped mountains or lush green meadows. What�s not You need to be patient with the format and style of Gandhi�s storytelling. There are moments with no sound or dialogue that provide a sort of pit stop to help us gather and soak in the fabric of each chapter. What to do Like the ship itself, the film breaks you down from within, part by part as you leave the theatre with images and sounds reverberating in your head making you uneasy. Not in a long time has a movie been able to accomplish this feat!</Review>

In Anand Gandhi�s near-masterpiece Ship of Theseus, Kabi plays a monk (presumably a Jain), an activist opposed to pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies testing their products on animals. When Kabi�s Maitreya learns that he is suffering from the cirrhosis of the liver, he refuses medical treatment, instead deciding to starve himself to death. As he brings the violence upon his body (some harrowing and moving scenes that reminded me of Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands on hunger strike in Steve McQueen�s Hunger) Maitreya also engages in a lively discourse with a young perky lawyer Charvaka (Vinay Shukla). No one wins the argument whether the monk should think about the greater good or compromise his beliefs and seek medical treatment for his ailment. But in watching the monk�s story -- the second in the three narratives in Ship of Theseus, the audience will be deeply rewarded with some of the best cinematic moments they have experienced in an Indian film. For one there is Pankaj Kumar�s mesmerizing cinematography -- long shots of monks dressed in white, walking in sparse countryside, to a haunting and a beautifully composed image of the same monks sitting on a rock as they stare at the ocean and Mumbai�s skyline in a distance. Gandhi�s writing, especially in this segment of the film is rich, packed with some of the most intelligent and thought-provoking dialogues that I have heard in an Indian film. And then there�s Kabi�s gentle, near spiritual performance. He continues to smile with every word he speaks, every argument he puts forth, even when he is in pain, lying wasted in a quiet magical monastery, that seems very far away from the Mumbai�s loud, boisterous world. In taking up three stories -- the first looks at a blind Arab photographer (Aida El-Kashef) whose life changes after she has a cornea transplant and the third about a stockbroker (Sohum Shah) who gets obsessed with seeking justice for a Mumbai slum dweller whose kidney has been stolen -- Gandhi examines the idea of identity. The title comes from a Greek myth and questions whether an object (a ship in the myth) remains the same, even after many of its parts have been replaced? Gandhi take three stories about organ donations and carries forward that same argument. As Vinay the stockbroker asks towards the end of the film, isn�t a man made up of his parts? His friend responds saying there must be something else in us, otherwise wouldn�t a person change if you replace his parts? For his first feature film (although he has made a couple of celebrated shorts) Gandhi shows a real command over the medium and his flair to narrate stories. The three stories in Ship of Theseus have very different tones -- the first examines art and how a blind person and then a person of sight looks at it (an idea explored even deeper in Jocelyn Moorhouse�s 1991 Australian film Proof with Hugo Weaving and Russell Crowe); the second a journey with a spiritual man and his ideas; and the third almost becomes a thriller, laced with some unexpected humor. The beauty of all the three stories lies in how Gandhi ties them up in the end. A three narrative structure was first explored in the west by a group of young masters, although now it is overused -- with limited success, by some indie filmmakers in India. But in Ship of Theseus, Gandhi gives us one of the most satisfying closures to a film. If some sections of the audience start to tear up towards the end that will be okay. Those would be tears of joy and of discovering a very special film. That Gandhi is an audacious filmmaker is an understatement. He has made a film with dialogues in English, Hindi, Marathi and even Swedish, making no compromises. And he mostly shot the film in Mumbai -- the city that brags about the growing number of 100 crore-club films. Ship of Theseus will never join the 100 crore-club. It was not made with that intention. But it has a right to stand on its own. I know there is an audience out there hungry for good new cinema. Ship of Theseus is the film they have been waiting for.</Review>

It's openly stated that this is an art house cinema and not meant for the popcorn entertainment loving mass. However, there's ample spoken about the film over the past year and the incessant appreciation that the film has bagged at each film festival gives enough push to a cinegoer to watch this stimulating fare. You enter the theater mentally conditioned that you are in for a sublime, thought-provoking, philosophical film that, thanks to the massive applauses, is supposed to be a gem of a film. You are expected to look at it differently, to find meanings out of the various metaphors the filmmaker presents, to apply yourself and discover the message subtly conveyed. This isn't an in-your-face film which offers the story upfront. You are expected to delve deeper to extract the meaning. And if during the meticulous process you lose the plot, it isn't the film but your fault. Phew! Quite a daunting task is what this film becomes. The movie courteously slips in the Theseus paradox which forms its spine. When deconstructed the paradox questions whether an object which has had all its elements replaced, remains fundamentally the same object. It's followed by another question that if it isn't the same object, which of the two (before and after) is essentially the real object. The philosophy basically coincides with Human existence, given the transformation a human life goes through over the course of a lifetime do we really continue to remain the person we were born as? This crux of the film is weaved through three different protagonists of three different stories who are interlinked by one common factor - that of organ transplant. While the first story is about a Blind Photographer Aaliya (Aida El-Kashef) who after getting her corneas transplanted to better her photography skills, instead ends up being overwhelmed by the surplus of subjects and ends up losing her focus. The second is that of a monk Maitreya (Neeraj Kabi) who's campaign against the violence done on animals by pharmaceutical companies leaves his ownself in odds for he develops an ailment that can only be cured by consuming the pills made by those pharmaceutical firms that he attacked. In the third you have a stockbroker Navin (Sohum Shah) who comes across an organ-transplant racket and he tries to redeem himself of the guilt of having an illegally acquired Kidney by fighting for a poor to get his stolen kidney back. This isn't one of those art films that make their point in a stipulated timeframe. SOT lingers on you through various extended sequences spread across 143 minutes and thanks to the exceptionally brilliant cinematography by Pankaj Kumar, you end up falling for each and every frame that captures the bustling city of Mumbai live never before. The arguments presented by Gandhi through this film are very enlightening as well as engaging. Right from the philosophy of the blind photographer to the diatribe of the monk and his friend Charvaka (Vinay Shukla) or even the questions on morality raised by the stockbroker leave you with various thoughts to mull over. But the drawback of SOT comes when you know that the filmmaker has only used the stories to conveniently put his points across. Except for the focus on passing the message, there's barely any effort done to establish the characters or the setting even. You would barely recall the various actors that aide his protagonists to present their arguments. Moreover, every story gets an abrupt end and before you realize, one story gives its way to another. To sum it up, Ship Of Theseus is definitely a stimulating affair but not without its flaws.</Review>

The monk is diagnosed with an illness that requires organ transplant, but he'd rather die than sacrifice his principles. The third is about a stock-broker, Navin (Sohum), who has survived a kidney transplant, but is shaken out of his self-consumed life when he learns all about the illicit organ trade. The film refers to an ancient paradox in which the Athenians replaced each rotting plank in the ship of Theseus until none of the original planks were left. It sparked an intellectually stimulating debate: Does it still remain fundamentally the same ship? It's shot mostly in documentary style, delving over similar philosophical queries - 'Who we are, how our thoughts can impact the universe, and how we tackle self-transformation and battle internal conflicts'. Gandhi's ruminative subject, catering to art-house cinema lovers (has won critical acclaim in international film festivals), is deeply layered and beautifully intricate. He doesn't compromise artistic depth for commerce, even for a moment, though the story-telling is not without flaws. The pace is exhaustingly slow and scenes monotonously long. This idea could be compressed into smaller 'lifeboats' and still sail safe. The monk's deeply profound story stands out. There's a light moment in the film where the monk is asked, "If you are celibate, why this intellectual masturbation?" Well, watch this if you are ready for some soul-searching that ends with an intellectual orgasm.</Review>

But if cheesy nostalgia is your thing and you want to be transported back to a timme when Central Jail was central in all Hindi drammas, then Enemmy mmight immpress you with Mithun Chakraborty and son headlining a dramma intersecting politicians, cops and of course, gangsters. It's the sort of filmm where politicians are gangsters, gangsters are cops, and cops play politics. And Chakraborty pieces it all together in his head. Sometimmes he talks to himmself, sometimmes we hear a VO of the words in his head, sometimmes he talks to his sidekick who mmight as well have been a mmanequin. The dramma does pick up in the second half as the screenplay finally starts taking shape. But this is mmore a blip, the last dregs of energy in a dead flashlight assisted by somme decent performmances by Kay Kay Menon and Sunil Shetty who try to rise above the writing. In fact Sunil Shetty has never looked better. Yes, we are clutching at straws here. Mmost of the first half is dependent on explanations via dialogue that could well put you to sleep. A mmandatory itemm song mmakes an appearance to shakes up proceedings but fails mmiserably. Where Enemmy shows somme mmoxie is by alluding to real politicians, but the plot and characters are so one-dimmensional that it seemms mmore like an effort to mmalign nammes rather than convince viewers. Technically too, the filmm is a couple of decades old. It's all about coverage, not aesthetics. It feels like the cammera has simmply been planted in the mmost convenient spot to cover all action. Only sound design stands out as it uses non-sync effects well to give the immpression of a lot mmore activity than what you see. Still, turning down the overall volumme especially for the background score would've helped.

Enemmy is just an extension to that genre with an insignificant facelift. Enemmy is designed as a multi-starrer action masala - a popular formula in the 80s. The problem is that, from the ensemble no one is exactly a star today. Nevertheless, everyone is a hero here (including Johnny Lever) and with limited option for a villain, junior artists are slaughtered every now and then to justify the action prerequisites. Suniel Shetty seems to have upgraded with this film. While he played the supporting actor who was often killed in the pre-climax in the 90s, now there are other actors to fill up the position. The problem is that you know who this privileged one is, right from the start. Also this is the kind of cinema where the heroine's sole purpose is to be the person who the villain can hold at gunpoint in the climax to get even with the hero. She is doubly as good if she plays a pregnant woman. Do you still ask for the storyline? Well it's about some politician whose several crores of black money gets robbed. He appoints a CBI officer (Mithun Chakravarthy) to investigate the case. The officer suspects a crime branch unit (Suniel Shetty, Kay Kay Menon, Johnny Lever, Mahaakshay) to be behind the robbery. Now, this is a much simplified version of the disjointed plot. Amidst politics, gangwar and other formulaic elements, the film goes nowhere. The direction is shoddy, the editing is pathetic, the background score overacts and the actors underperform. Kay Kay Menon is the only one who makes an effort but in vain. In their home production, there isn't even an effort to make the scene between Mithun and his son Mahaakshay stand out. It is as humdrum as the film. Needless to say - keep safe distance from this enemy!</Review>

The film is about law and order and the battle between the Mumbai mafia and police. Would it work with the masses? We tell you. A major Gang-war has broken out in Mumbai city with a staggering amount of money going missing. Four officers from a special unit, Eklavya (Suniel Shetty), Naeem (Kay Kay Menon), Madhav (Mahaakshay Chakraborty) and Eric (Johny Lever) are deployed to stop the gang war under any condition. They nab the biggest don Mukhtar Menon (Zakir Hussain) but despite putting him behind bars, the war doesn't end. Enters CBI Officer Yugantar Sharma (Mithun Chakraborty) who starts investigating the case and realizes there's more to it than meets the eye. How the four officers come under suspicion for the missing money and how he stops Mukhtar's operations even from his prison is what follows through the rest of the plot. The biggest obstacle in Enemmy is its dated approach. The entire idea of gang war, political intervening, the helplessness of the cops etc. is highly jaded and done to death in the past. Filmmaker Ashuu Trikha falters completely in creating a major conflict or reason for everything. Right from a one line mention of money going missing to a brief addition of the poor economic conditions of our cops to even a wafer-thin reasoning for a major gang-war, everything is half-baked and executed with excessive cinematic liberty. Owing to which nothing is convincing and you do not feel for any character. Another drawback to the film is the lack of a strong baddie. Every known actor is righteous and fighting a battle against the bad leaving only a repetitive Zakir Hussain to play the bad guy who is neither ruthless nor menacing. Even in acting one finds all the old timers finding their place in the film. However, the cast mostly shoulders the jaded script right till the end. Suniel Shetty appears completely in his elements and plays even an unconvincing part convincingly. Mithun Chakraborty too is stellar and a delight to watch on screen. Johny Lever tries really hard to play a stern cop in what would be his first serious film but blame it on his body of work in comedy that you can't help but giggle everything he comes on screen. Mahaakshay also the producer's son this time around gets a decent part to play but he hams his way through it. Zakir Hussain gets stereotyped in his character once again. The man should seriously consider a switch in the kind of roles he is enacting. Uvika Chaudhary gets nothing more than a scene and a dialogue to perform. To sum it up, Enemmy could've worked well with the masses if it was the '80s era. In the present times thanks to the many films one has seen in similar genre, it fails to thrill.</Review>

Let the title ENEMMY not mislead you into believing that this one's about a war with the neighbouring country or with the extremists. This one's about the battle within: The conflict between cops and gangsters. A recipe that's worked several times in the past� Without beating around the bush, let me state that masala movies that depict the fight between virtuous/upright and evil/wicked can never go out of fashion. Bollywood has been churning out such masaledaar entertainers since time immemorial. Asshu Trikha's ENEMMY too borrows from films of yore. The good news is that ENEMMY remains faithful to the entertainers that masses love and relish. The distressing news is that ENEMMY relies too heavily on unabashed conventionalism, brandishing the same stuff in the name of entertainment. A thriller set against the backdrop of the battle between the Mumbai mafia and cops, ENEMMY is the story of four officers [Suniel Shetty, Kay Kay Menon, Johny Lever and Mahaakshay], who are entrusted with the responsibility of cracking down on the underworld and cleaning up the city by any and all means possible. When the four initiate an investigation and manage to nab Mukhtar [Zakir Hussain], a crime lord, everyone heaves a sigh of relief. However, the relief is short-lived and after a brief spell of peace, the gang-wars start again, shocking everyone. Deciding to up the ante, the political leader R.G. [Akshay Kapoor] sends a CBI officer [Mithun Chakraborty] to Mumbai to get to the bottom of things. However, what the officer discovers is that the gang-war is merely a fa�ade to find out about a heist, in which hard cash was stolen from Mukhtar, who will stop at nothing to get his money back. The question is... who is crazy enough to steal from the king of the city underworld? Trikha borrows every ingredient on the shelf that constitutes an entertainer -- cops versus gangsters, fists of fury, heavy-duty drama, item song, clap-trap dialoguebaazi... as a matter of fact, he goes full throttle with the assets available on shelf. This is vintage 80s masala that refuses to age. Once the stage is set, the narrative, although interesting at times, meanders into been-there-seen-that kind of situations, more so towards the penultimate moments. Sure, Trikha tries to integrate a twist or two in the tale, but, again, you know where the film is heading a few sequences later. The soundtrack too pays homage to the films of yore. The song towards the end credits is the best of the lot. ENEMMY relies heavily on action and the stunts/action do give you adrenaline rush at times. Dialogue are aimed at the hoi polloi. Although it boasts of an ensemble cast, it is Mithun, the veteran, who stands out with an earnest performance. Suniel is in top form after a hiatus. Kay Kay fits into the masala scenario faultlessly. Mahaakshay shows vast improvement over his earlier works and seems more self-assured and confident now. Johny Lever, cast in a serious role, is alright. Zakir Hussain, playing the menacing villain, is first-rate. He's mean and maniacal without trying too hard. Yuvika Chaudhary doesn't get much to do. Priyanka Upendra is alright. Deepraj Rana is wasted. Akshay Kapoor plays the mandatory politician well. On the whole, ENEMMY is vintage masala in a new avatar. This one's aimed at the masses primarily!</Review>

      <Review Id="209" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/review-ankur-arora-murder-case-comatose-drama/1129084/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="15th June, 2013" Likes="4" Rating="2/5">A little boy dies after a botched operation in a hospital that's run for profit. This may be something that happens all the time because doctors are humans, and humans are prone to error. But young Ankur Arora's death-by-negligence makes conscience-stricken young intern Dr Romesh (Mathur) throw all caution to the winds, and go after the brilliant Dr Asthana (Menon). Romesh is backed by the heart-broken mother (Chopra), a comely lawyer (Dam) who starts crooked but gets back to the straight and narrow, and, eventually, the girl he loves (Singh). So there's your classic David vs Goliath story in a hospital setting, beginning with the promise of relevance. Which is belied soon after. The film intends to be part hospital procedural, part courtroom drama, with a dash of chase-and-hunt thriller, all very Robin Cook-ish. Kay Kay Menon plays the surgeon who is more interested in getting himself in media limelight and gathering money for the cash-rich hospital. The clash between an all-powerful doctor who has lost sight of his primary purpose of saving lives, and the intern who is willing to lose everything in the fight for justice should have made for cracking drama. But Ankur Arora Murder Case never really gets there, suffering from banal script-and story-telling, and amateurish acting. Tatari's previous debut film (Summer of 2007) also revolved around the medical profession and issues that arise from the urban privileged being criminally unaware of ground realities in rural India. Despite its clunky title, that film did better with detailing its core. Here too, the subject of medical negligence is of grave importance, and not dealt with any degree of seriousness by Bollywood. This one had the potential to go a different route. The Vikram Bhatt (he's the producer and the writer) effect strikes, and it becomes a thing of loud declamations and predictable outcomes. Mathur is easy, and that makes it easier for us to sit through. But an actor of the calibre of Menon being made to shout mars it. And Chopra is ill-used: as the bereft mother, she could have brought more to the table, and left us with more empathy. Pity because this could have been a medico-legal thriller with teeth.</Review>

Producer Vikram Bhatt and director Suhail Tatari take the engagement level a notch higher by basing it on real incidents, but the Bollywoodization that creeps into the treatment ultimately dilutes the experience. The best bits come in the first half as the screenplay keeps a stranglehold on your attention with some excellent scenes with well-rounded characters. The idealistic intern, his conflicted girlfriend, a high-profile megalomaniac doctor who messes up a straightforward case, and the mother of the victim: little Ankur Arora. A host of rich supplementary characters complete the ensemble. Tatari does well in getting the audience to sympathize with the relationships they share. Take for example how the sick kid wants to take up for his single mum or the choices the dating interns make after a conversation that leaves you wondering what you would do if you were in their shoes. In the second half, the film loses its footing with some lazy writing. When the lawyers turn up and the action shifts outside the hospital and to the courthouse, the makers get decidedly Bollywood. The casting choice of Paoli Dam as the defense counsel should give you a clue as to what you may expect. Even as a lawyer, she's teetering on becoming typecast. However, the big issue with the film for me was its artificial look and glossy treatment. This isn't a subject to be presented with immaculate symmetric art direction and perfectly lit frames. How many interns - doctors in training who barely get any sleep - have spotless, pristine apartments with fresh flowers decorating the mantelpiece? Zero, I suspect. Even the hospital scenes lack a certain grittiness. Given the plethora of references out there, this should've been a no-brainer. The medical terminology has been dumbed down for the sake of screenplay, but that's no fun. If you've watched enough hospital dramas, inaccessible words and procedures are only add to the validity. Kay Kay Menon does a stellar turn as the vile Dr Asthana. You know this because you detest his character despite it often straying from the realms of believability. Yet moments like when he carelessly plonks the job of informing the family of the patient's "complication" on an inexperienced intern hit the nail on the head. Tisca Chopra and Arjun Mathur hold their own. Ankur Arora has an important point to make and a scary reality to represent. Often we equate doctors with god-like reverence, but occasionally they might mistakenly believe - given that they hold people's lives in their hands - that they are, indeed, god. This is a story of one such case. And it is a story worth listening to. Just try and take Bollywood out of it.</Review>

A hospital and a court of law are two places that any average human would like to keep safe distance from, unless unavoidable. So while this might seem like a depressing setup for a film, Ankur Arora Murder Case essentially is an important cinema that dares to go into unpleasant and uncharted territory and emphasize on professional responsibilities (or the lack of it). Dr Asthana (Kay Kay Menon) is amongst the topmost surgeons in the city and heads a high-class hospital. Due to unintentional laxity in one minor surgery, a child patient Ankur Arora loses his life. An intern from the hospital, Dr Romesh (Arjun Mathur) seeks justice for such medical negligence on part of Asthana and, along with the child's mother (Tisca Chopra), files a case against the doctor and hospital. Lawyer Kajori Sen (Paoli Dam) represents them in the court of law for a legal battle which isn't as easy as it seems. In terms of its story structure, the film, more or less, has similar conflicts as Rajkumar Santoshi's Damini (1993), one of the best courtroom dramas and fight-for-justice film in Bollywood. Arjun Mathur's male protagonist here is as much idealistic as Meenashi Sheshadri's Damini. And while that certainly means going against the tide, Dr Romesh (like in Damini) also has to go against the love of his life (Vishakha Singh), a co-intern who isn't willing to compromise on her ambitious career in medicine over the case. What sets the film apart is the hospital backdrop it chooses and the strong and honest attempt it makes to bring forth the commercialization in the medical profession and well as medical negligence. And while such concerns have often been addressed on small screen through social talk shows like Satyamev Jayate or crime-thrillers like Crime Patrol, it is director Suhail Tatari's skilful handling of the drama that gives this one a riveting feature film profile. Vikram Bhatt's screenplay is crisp, well-defined and with no surplus scenes. Shagufta Rafique adds her bit to the drama through the expressive and effective dialogues. The second half basically plays as a courtroom drama with all the regular elements - of evidence being tampered and witnesses turning hostile. With the focus being to underline the medical negligence leading to the death of Ankur Arora, there is no element of mystery in the murder and thereby the court case is kinda predictable. However there is a decent attempt to add layers to lawyer Kajori Sen's character by making her more human than showing her as the standard saviour. Having a child victim adds more vulnerability to the entire issue. With the idealistic fight for justice that the film endorses, the protagonist in form of Dr Romesh is as much uncompromising. The antagonist in the form of Dr Asthana is however not completely black but has shades of grey. His negligence is not intentional but he isn't willing to take responsibility for the same. And thereby the film tries to reinstate that sense of accountability in doctors and, at a larger level, in every professional. The film is blessed with some accomplished performances. After several small roles, Arjun Mathur gets to play a significant character and puts in a poised performance. Playing a mother marred with ill-fate and hopelessness, Tisca Chopra is absolutely amazing. Vishakha Singh and Paoli Dam are decent in their respective roles. And finally it's Kay Kay Menon who grabs most attention with his nuanced act. The indifference and highhandedness that he brings to his character of an arrogant doctor is incredibly real. And his outburst in the climax has the trademark Kay Kay Menon intensity. Ankur Arora Murder Case is a film that will scare you and make you squirm in your seats. It makes a significant statement that no life is less significant!</Review>

The film revolves around Dr Asthana ( Kay Kay Menon) a surgeon put on a pedestal because of the number of high-profile lives he has saved. Cocky Asthana rules Shekawat General Hospital with an iron hand. Things are going real smooth for the star surgeon till little Ankur Arora (Vishesh Tiwari) is wheeled into his operation theatre for an appendictis surgery. A medical procedure that should be a child's play for Asthana then becomes a nightmare because of his own negligence. Ankur's death is hushed up. And life continues like normal. Till one young conscientious intern Dr Romesh ( Arjun Mathur) stumbles upon some clues. The cause of Ankur's death is then played out and Romesh makes it his business to expose the senior doctor who he had idolised but who actually turned out to be a surgeon with hands of clay. Best Reader's Review  Tatari is a winner in his choice of a subject. The story that has been researched from a true life incident does provide meaningful insights about the medical fraternity and facilities. However while the film is an eye-opener on medical skullduggery, it fails to become cutting edge cinema because the screenplay offers few surprises. And, a title that is a dead give away. Also for a dramatic film of this nature, the performances are so placid, they leave you cold. The drama that unfolds between the hospital and the court room should have definitely had more spunk and twists. Note: You may not like this film if medical negligence is not a subject you wish to bog yourself down with in a movie hall.</Review>

But Ankur Arora Murder Case fails to make a strong enough case for itself. The film�s lack of vitality stems from factors that are embedded in the comatose screenplay, which has neither much sting nor any imagination. For one, the title is a dead giveaway, as a result of which one large chunk of the film is completely predictable. The audience knows a death is on the way and that it is going to lead to a �murder case�. The first half plays out largely in an upscale medical facility; the second unfolds in a rather sterile courtroom where two lawyers who share more than just a profession square off against each other in what turns out to be a dreary legal contest. Moreover, neither the hotshot general surgeon guilty of committing a costly human error nor the hapless mother of the eponymous boy who pays with his life for the hospital�s negligence is anything more than a character type. They do not evolve beyond the specific function apportioned to them by the screenplay. The three other principal characters in the narrative � two young medical interns and a lawyer � fare no better. The doctor is a swaggering, arrogant man (Kay Kay Menon) who believes that he is god. When a tycoon grievously injured in an accident is wheeled into the hospital, the surgeon shoos everybody, including the patient�s son, away and, like a cocky pugilist stepping into a boxing ring, declares: �I�m the best.� Not only does the doc�s unseemly bravado ring utterly false, you also instantly know that this guy is going to be in serious trouble sooner than later. The unsuspecting lady (Tisca Chopra) who admits her son in the hospital � he is brought in with an innocuous stomach ache only to be sent to the OT for an appendicitis surgery � is a working woman who has separated from her husband. But that is all there is to her. Her character graph remains absolutely static � she does not grow into the tragic figure that she is meant to be even after she experiences the agony of losing her young son. She also faces the prospect of her seemingly watertight case against the doctor and the hospital owner (Harsh Chhaya) falling apart in the face of the machinations of a cynical advocate (Manish Chaudhary), but she remains as stoic as ever. The other characters, too, are damned to be stuck in a drab groove. A diffident but upright intern (Arjun Mathur), who freezes during a surgery and is barred from entering the OT, decides to play whistle-blower and sleuth. His live-in girlfriend and fellow intern (Vishakha Singh), a small-town girl desperate to make it big in the medical profession, refuses to jeopardize her career by supporting her lover�s crusade. The victims hire a female lawyer (Paoli Dam), who, on her part, has a skeleton in her cupboard. The script follows a simple logic: if it�s a woman, she must be a real tough nut. So, the single mother has a male friend who is always by her side, the female intern defies her middle class moorings and shares her boyfriend�s living quarters, and the lawyer appears all too willing to have a baby out of wedlock. They deserved a better script. The problem with Ankur Arora Murder Case is that promises much but delivers little. The manner in which director Suhail Tatari handles the narrative is commendably earnest up to a point. He proffers no cheap thrills. The script, too, sticks to its primary concern and eschews formula-ridden set pieces. The film also throws in plenty of medical procedures and terminology, suggesting that a great deal of homework has been done. If you keep your ears open, you might even learn what a headache or the common cold is called in the books. But you don�t quite begin to care for the men and women on the screen enough to either hate them or root for them. So the tale of a mother fighting for justice against all odds lacks the requisite combustion. Despite the limited bandwidth each one is given, the actors are all first-rate. Kay Kay Menon gives the self-important surgeon a suitable air of nonchalance. If Tisca Chopra isn�t able to present a poignant portrait of loss and tenacity, it is because the character is ill-advisedly stodgy. Arjun Mathur gives the intern who stakes everything at the altar of truth a certain degree of energy, while Vishakha Singh, after making quite a strong impression in the initial sequences, falls into a rut that is clearly not of her own making. As for Paoli Dam, she is definitely worth more than what this role might seem to indicate. For the film as whole, it is two stars for intention but only half for execution.</Review>

But we often hear/read about unscrupulous practices that bring disrepute and disgrace to this dignified vocation. It's often said that the underprivileged or poverty-stricken are most affected by medical malpractices or laxity, but I don't concur with this stance entirely. It affects the upper crust too. Goof ups by health centers or inside the operation theatres is a commonality the world over. The most glaring case in point is that of Michael Jackson, which hit front page news across the globe... After attempting erotic thrillers and murder mysteries, Vikram Bhatt delves into the realistic zone with ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE, which tackles the issue of medical neglect. Besides, this film goes beyond the issue of medical negligence. What happens when justice is denied to the victim's family? Vikram and director Suhail Tatari take the spectator from inside the operation theatre to a courtroom, where an eminent surgeon is tried for medical recklessness. Dr. Romesh [Arjun Mathur] was in awe of Dr. Asthana [Kay Kay Menon] of Shekhawat General Hospital. He had a live-in relationship with Dr. Riya [Vishakha Singh], his co-intern and the love of his life. However, when an 8-year-old boy Ankur [Vishesh Tiwari] dies due to Dr. Asthana's medical negligence, Romesh realizes that a good surgeon is not necessarily a good human being as well. Together with Ankur's mother Nandini [Tisca Chopra], Romesh sets out on a turbulent journey to fight for what is right. A battle for justice against his mentor, the hospital and the love of his life. Reportedly based on a true incident, ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE focuses not just on the negligence in the operation theatre, but also throws light on the justice mechanism in our country. Come to think of it, a film like ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE acts as wake up call for many a doctor or those associated with this profession/medical lobbies, besides making the spectator cognizant of the fact that we ought to have a dedicated procedure for speedy disposal of such cases. The director develops his characters well, keeps the goings-on as authentic as possible and mounts the tension steadily. The only time the movie gets formulaic is when the warring lawyers are shown in an intimate relationship. Those portions, although handled persuasively, seem pretentious and exaggerated, but Tatari ensures the film is back on track towards the concluding stages. A few sequences before the culmination also seem stretched. Also, the sting operation will have its share of advocates and adversaries. Tatari's handling of the intricate subject matter merits admiration and so does Vikram's choice of theme. Besides the taut screenplay, the dialogue as well as the background music accentuates the proceedings delightfully. Ideally, ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE should've been a songless film. That way it would've enhanced and also justified the cause of making this movie. ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE is embellished with commanding performances. Kay Kay, as expected, is exceptional in a character that has disconcerting shades. Tisca Chopra is splendid as the mother who loses her child. The defenselessness, anguish and suffering she communicates seem so bona fide. Arjun Mathur shines in his part and what's more, stands up to an accomplished actor like Kay Kay in several sequences. Vishakha Singh is proficient, handling her part with sensitivity. Paoli Dam delivers a power-packed performance, managing her character with supreme confidence. Ditto for Manish Chaudhari, who does a commendable job. Vishesh Tiwari is alright. Harsh Chhaya and Sachin Khurana are adequate. On the whole, ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE illustrates and spotlights on the gaffes in the medical profession most persuasively. A heartfelt effort that deserves to be watched!</Review>

Leading lady Preity Zinta, unfortunately, is too well known to hide behind a fake name. Preity, playing Ishkq, a permanently perky Parisian photographer, is the sort of girl who takes off for the weekend to Rome because she &quot;loves being served by Italian waiters&quot;. On a train back home, she meets pretty boy Akash (Rhehan Malliek, formerly known as Gaurav Chanana), and no sooner than you've uttered the words &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, they're spending the day wandering about the French capital drinking, partying, and discussing life and relationships. Preity, who is credited not only as star, but also as producer and co-screenplay writer of this muddled film, continues to rely on her dimpled smile and her sparkly eyes to do all the heavy lifting as far as her performance goes. But those tropes have gotten rusty from overuse. Ishkq and Akash hit it off, but love is not on the menu. Ishkq, you see, is allergic to marriage, having seen her own mother (legendary French actress Isabelle Adjani) go through a messy divorce from her dad. Writer-director Prem Raj (formerly Prem Soni, who helmed that forgettable Salman Khan-Kareena Kapoor starrer 'Main Aur Mrs Khanna') piles on the cliches, slipping into a quicksand of regressive ideas and over-familiar stereotypes. The film becomes increasingly soppy in its second half, but never in a way that you truly care for its characters. And how can you anyway? Former TV actor and born-again newcomer Rhehan Malliek is as expressive as a slab of granite, and it doesn't help that his voice is so obviously dubbed. Preity Zinta shimmies and shakes, and giggles till her jaws must hurt, but delivers only one genuinely moving moment in a scene set in a hotel room where she opens her heart to Akash. But no one ought to be more embarrassed than poor Isabelle Adjani who's dubbed in clunky Hindi, and must even suffer the indignity of dancing like a junior artiste in an Indian wedding song. 'Ishkq in Paris' is a misguided, overwrought affair that feels way longer than its 96 minutes. I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five. Watch it if you can muster the courage.

Ishqk in Paris is a case in point. It's adequately shot (of course, point a lens anywhere in Paris and you'll have framed potential art) and no expense is spared in giving it a Karan Johar production-type feel, which is to say they haven't skimped on the look in any way. And yet, this would be fine if Ishqk in Paris were a coffee table book. But of course, a film needs to be much more than that. To watch a supposedly intense heart wrenching breakup scene while Rhehan Malliek is dressed in a perfectly ironed pink shirt and pink sweater sitting on an idyllic Parisian countryside bench just doesn't cut it. Broken from the inside, Ishqk (Preity Zinta) overcompensates by being uninhibited and pretends to be all happy-go-lucky. She meets a man just like her and they spend a night walking the streets of Paris. They promise each other not to exchange emails and phone numbers. And that there never will be a next time. Doesn't this sound uncannily like Linklater's Before Sunrise, the sequel of which was even set in Paris?! What an insane co-incidence. But where Linklater's film ends, Bollywood begins. Never mind the promises, he Facebooks her and stalks her to her home. And then like an assembly line production, Ishqk in Paris lumbers on without heart. There is little chemistry up front between the lead pair. This would've inadvertently worked out for the film because both characters hate the idea of love, commitment, and marriage and are happier with one-night stands and in such a scenario this wouldn't be important to begin with but as the narrative marches on towards the most obvious of Bollywood endings, their chemistry remains as questionable as Mona Lisa's smile. The problem with Ishqk in Paris is that it is too convenient a love story and ends on a faux note that is simply not who the characters are no matter how much the circumstances might've changed overnight for them. It is a lamentable moment for Priety Zinta, now in her twilight years as a lead actress in an ageist, unkind industry, that she has to choose a path of safety and ends up with a movie that needs a Salman Khan item. This film could've been so much more honest, real, gritty even. That would've been a worthy, valiant last stand. Meg Ryan - you could say she was Zinta's Hollywood equivalent - tried such a thing in one of her last films, In the Cut. Zinta exclaims (more than once) "I love Bollywood". It's a plea really. Bollywood doesn't seem to love her back anymore. And if the circus no longer has a spot to accommodate your act, by all means set up on the fringe, outside. But don't show people what they're going into the tent to see anyway. Be bold, change the act.</Review>

In male-dominated Bollywood, that takes guts (but then Preity is a lady who has testified against the mafia, so what's producing a film). I was less convinced about guts translating into practical filmmaking sense the moment the promos started airing. As Salman Khan did his item cameo, Preity's Ishkq In Paris shouted out a jaded look. It was almost as if she had made the film in her heydays - the last decade - and brought it out of cold storage only now. Ishkq (Preity) meets Akash (Rhehan Malliek) on a train and the two share an evening in Paris. Ishkq, though, insists on a no-baggage pact - that they should not carry any emotional residue from the encounter. So Ishkq moves on but Akash has fallen in love with her. What follows is what you might have guessed. They will meet again - in Paris, of course - and most of what follows is about whether Akash will finally manage to win over Ishkq. In fits, the film brings back faint shades of Hum Tum or London Paris New York, though by and large it manages taking an original line. Director Prem Raj, returning after the Salman Khan dud Main Aurr Mrs Khanna, seems out of loop in blending romance with melodrama. The lead duo's chemistry suffers. Preity is feisty as ever but she isn't doing anything she might not have already done in a zillion films before. Rhehan could do with some screen presence and you marvel at Isabelle Adjani's assured grace in a cameo. None of the cast - superstar item boy Salman included - can save a bad script from sinking, though.</Review>

When we first met Preity Zinta, we were bowled over by those sparkling eyes, those dimples and that genuinely fresh candour. When, in Dil Se, Shah Rukh Khan choked on his burger as she casually asked about virginity, we could relate. We rooted against the girl his character loved because of the character we invariably fell for, dooming the movie�s fate without realising it. And it felt worth it. What a girl, that fiesty, ebullient, Perk-eating Zinta. That was fifteen years ago. In this Friday�s release -- the moronically spelt Ishkq In Paris -- Zinta assails us with those dimples in the hopes that things haven�t changed. Tragically, she seems almost determined not to act. She straddles the line between French and Hindi clumsily, speaking in a bit of a supervillain accent. Her eyes sparkle with the eagerness of a jumpy squirrel, even when they shouldn�t. (Really, should anybody�s?) There is a bit too much enthusiasm, too much bounce to her character, who shrugs all the time and nods rapidly and constantly, like a big Preity bobble-head. Without a cricketer in embracing range, Zinta doesn�t seem to know what to do with herself. This, as you should have guessed from the title or the posters or the heading of this review, is a bad film. Evidence can be found in the fact that the men in the film, having worked previously on truly dismal projects, decided to come to this one with names changed. Director Prem Raj was formerly called Prem Soni, and made a trainwreck called Main Aur Mrs Khanna; leading man Rrehan Malliek used to go by Gautam Chanana and last starred in Himesh Reshammiya�s Kajra Re, a film that furtively ran in two Mumbai theatres for three days. This Paris project, then, is like their witness protection program, their chance to carve new identities. Not the best pick, alas. Somewhere in the middle of all this mediocrity is iconic French actress Isabelle Adjani, playing a Parisian playwright called Maria. The film opens with her reading from a script she�s written, and just when we think that perhaps something interesting may unfold from this unquestionably talented leading lady, she switches from English to Hindi with a ghastly bit of dubbing -- I have a feeling Adjani�s irritating Hindi voice belongs to the woman who dubbed for Nargis Fakhri in Rockstar. I might indeed be wrong, but no wronger than the filmmakers. The story of Ishkq and Akash -- for that infuriatingly spelt Ishkq is the name of a character -- forms Maria�s latest play, and from what we hear of the play, it seems she had watched Jab We Met a few times and then felt Geet needed to be an imbecile. Maria, while beautiful, is clearly a hack, for the love story she describes is so unbearably generic that the script could have been assembled by putting together the outtakes from any number of romantic movies. Young fellow meets Manic Punjabi Dream Woman (ahem) in Paris, they Before Sunrise it for a night, and then Salman Khan pops up for a song. Textbook, truly. Ah, but even this hunk-less hunky-dory state can�t last forever. In a laughably bad heel turn, the hero goes from sap to scumbag in the space of one scene, going from cooing to cursing and berating the heroine�s family. Which, it turns out, she and her mom don�t mind as much. Clearly these characters deserve one another. �This is a rubbish love story,� Zinta says in the film�s most honest, self-aware moment. �I need a drink.� Ditto, miss. And you best be buying.</Review>

So Ishkq (Preity Zinta) and Akash (Rhehan Malliek) end up doing everything predictable, like any average accustomed couple would do, from partying to dining and whispering sweet nothings (stress on 'nothing'). So, the first half is laden with boundless boredom with one of the most uneventful screenplays encountered in a rom-com. The two go their own ways by interval and you assume that separation might add some depth to their love story. Alas five minutes in the second half and Akash returns to Paris to be with Ishkq and what follows is almost a rerun of the first half, as the two keep roaming aimlessly around Paris streets once again. Love happens but Ishkq is commitment phobic. Her fear emerges out of her parents' failed marriage. The film tries too hard to rely on this frail conflict. And finally Ishkq in Paris ends up being the zillionth love story where the heroine runs to the airport to stop the hero from boarding a flight. To its merit, the film has decent production values, showcases picturesque Paris locales and also has a Salman Khan dance-number cameo. Alas beyond this, Ishkq in Paris has absolutely nothing to boast of. Films can charm you with minimalism but not nothingness, which is the case there. The proceedings do not amuse and the chemistry between the lead couple is palpably missing. Ishkq also mentions about her half-baked lovelorn past where she had a failed relationship with someone she refers to as sapera! Not that you care about him but no wonder India is still considered as a country of snake-charmers. It's nice to see Preity Zinta after a while but the lackluster love story doesn't do justice to her talent. We have seen much better works by the actress, in the past. Rhehan Malliek is not bad but again isn't able to rise over the script. French actress Isabelle Adjani carries a blank expression throughout and seems lost in translation. Also her voice changes when she speaks in Hindi thanks to some pathetic dubbing. Ishkq in Paris is bland love story!</Review>

Ishkq in Paris , which she has produced, co-written and starred in, is an attempt to gift herself the leading role that nobody wants to give her any more. Zinta�s trademark bubbliness has gone a bit flat, her late-30s body has filled out, and parts of her face look different, but she remains the liveliest presence in Ishkq in Paris. Her enthusiasm at being back in front of the camera is not curbed by her co-star, who struggles visibly to generate the spark and presence needed to boost his leading man credentials. The television actor formerly known as Gaurav Chanana, who now goes by the numerologically correct name Rhehan Malliek, plays Akash, a sinister-looking agent who runs into Ishkq (Zinta) in the city of love and falls for her over several hours spent in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower. Director Prem Raj (who previously directed Main Aurr Mrs Khanna under the name Prem Soni) attempts to recreate the casual banter and slow-burning frisson from such strangers-meeting-cute romances as Before Sunset and Serendipity, but it is as hard to carry off a movie in which one half of the romance is miscast as it is to breathe with only one lung. Malliek isn�t the only stranger on the set. Ishkq boasts of French arthouse actor Isabelle Adjani and Indian film-maker Shekhar Kapur for parents. That�s the advantage, one supposes, of producing your own movie�you get to persuade Adjani to play your mother and pretend to speak in Hindi (Adjani�s Hindi dialogue is dubbed). Adjani�s perpetually startled expression could, perhaps, be attributed to her frozen facial muscles and uncannily wide eyes. Even Kapur, who wanders confusedly into the movie as though he has been teleported from another planet, displays more feeling than Adjani. Kooky parents, a charisma-free love interest�poor Ishkq is made to pay for her unconventional romantic choices (she has a thing for Italian waiters, she says). If the movie works at all, it is because Prem Raj restricts the lopsided affair to 96 minutes, and Zinta�s joy at being the cynosure of attention is undeniably contagious.</Review>

Who would've thought that even the once upon a time superstar Preity Zinta too would struggle to release her production venture? But if the rumours are to be believed, partly through personal crises and partly by not finding the takers, Preity's film Ishkq In Paris remained in the pipelines for a very long time. The film, eventually sees the light of the day and here's a brief review of what this film is all about. Akash (Rhehan Malliek) is a workaholic agent from London who believes in one night stands and doesn't want to get tangled in relationships. Ishkq (Preity Zinta) withholding pain within prefers losing herself between strangers and doesn't want to marry either. What happens when the two stumble upon each other in the world's most romantic city Paris and decide to spend an entire night partying together? Does cupid strike?  It's safe to state that romance can hardly be devoid of cliches in Hindi cinema and hence probably the most difficult genre to execute in the present times. Directed by Prem Soni who last made the box-office wash out Main Aur Mrs. Khanna seeks inspiration from two of the most celebrated romantic films in Hollywood Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and squashes them together part by part in first and second half. If the ripping off wasn't enough, he goes ahead and stuffs all the desi elements landing with a tripe film by the end of it. The first half although slightly breezy becomes bearable but it's the drama in the second half, all the hue and cry along with a pointless stress on the backstory is what numbs your sense of boredom. Preity Zinta is what soothes most of the sore points of the film. Undoubtedly the most ebullient of stars today, Preity makes a comeback in her much loved cute and bubbly self and plays her part well. Rhehan Maliek is easy on the eyes too but you only which there could be more clarity to his character and a wishy-washy job. The renowned French actress/singer Isabelle Adjani may just have been cast owing to her similarities with Preity Zinta in looks because the actress does nothing but appear clueless throughout the film. Salman Khan adds oodles of charm in a small dance cameo itself. Music by Sajid-Wajid is listless and neither adds or takes away from the story. Cinematography is top notch and the locations in Paris get beautifully captured. To sum it up Ishkq In Paris takes off as a frothy affair but ends up being a melodramatic saga which can bore you easily.</Review>

Alas, in Prem Soni's Ishkq in Paris, this doesn't happen. The girl is afraid of commitment and the guy is happy to play along. So they soak in the sights�the Eiffel Tower especially�drink, dance, make a mock film and do several insipid things but never get around to being serious. Love is not on the agenda as yet. Nearly one half of the film is wasted, doing precious nothing. When your patience starts to wear thin, you're told the reason why the beautiful Ishkq is against commitment is because her French mother Marie (Isabella Adjani) has been ditched by her Indian father (Shekhar Kapur) when she was just seven. This Indo-French girl therefore lives in a cocoon; hates marriage and fears divorce. So even though romance may have stared her in the eye at that chance meeting with the light-eyed Aakash, on their first night in Paris, Ishkq continues with her life as if nothing ever happened. Aakash returns to London where he is a humdrum existence as an agent(whatever!). Few reels later, they reunite at one of his friend's wedding in Paris. In round two, they drink, frolic and dance. To the audience's delight, they even manage to snag a balle balle with Salman Khan in a lovable cameo. By now, Aakash is very sure that he loves Ishkq. However the stubborn woman that she is, she will not concede. Finally the script runs out of steam and Ishkq, thank God for that, runs straight into Aakash's arms in true Bollywood style. Preity Zinta's maiden production has its aesthetics in place. Paris is enchanting. The actress is good but there ends the show.</Review>
      <Review Id="224" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/547317" Affiliation="bollywood hungama.com" Date="24th May, 2013" Likes="93" Rating="2.5">Romance is the most favored genre in Bollywood, but love stories have undergone a metamorphosis in the recent past. Films like EK MAIN AUR EKK TU, LOVE AAJ KAL, WAKE UP SID, LONDON PARIS NEW YORK and COCKTAIL have redefined romance in our movies. The anguish which germinates from heartbreak, the outburst of emotions when matters of the heart fail and making peace with oneself and the loved one eventually... the storytellers are in a mood to push the envelope further. ISHKQ IN PARIS is yet another addition to the new-age, urban setting love tale. The film is significant because, besides its theme, it marks Preity Zinta's tryst with film production, besides signaling her return to the big screen after a hiatus. Bearing an uncanny resemblance to the romantic fare BEFORE SUNRISE [Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy], ISHKQ IN PARIS also brings back memories of LONDON PARIS NEW YORK, which released a year ago. Needless to say, ISHKQ IN PARIS is different from the above-named films in terms of story development and execution. When an entire film centers on first getting acquainted and then going separate ways, it puts enormous pressure on the storyteller to make every sequence vital. He/she needs to glisten relentlessly. Even accomplished writers/directors find it most demanding to portray a couple falling in love and drifting apart within a few hours of meeting each other... Prem Soni does have a tough task on his shoulders to depict the wobbly relationship between the protagonists. Prem borrows the attitude from BEFORE SUNRISE and BEFORE SUNSET films, but he makes sure he affixes those delicate touches that appeal to the Indian cineastes. Since the film is chatty in nature, there are times when weariness sets in and the lines seem contrived [the first hour is strictly okay!], but, eventually, this one springs a pleasant surprise! ISHKQ IN PARIS narrates the story of two strangers, Ishkq [Preity Zinta] and Aakash [Rhehan Malliek], who meet on a train from Rome to Paris and end up spending an evening in Paris. Sparks fly, the two share some wonderful moments before they go separate ways... only to meet again! What goes in favor of ISHKQ IN PARIS is the vibe and the chemistry between its lead actors. The love story has its moments, the humor is subtle and believable and the writers [Preity Zinta, Prem Soni] make sure they spike the narrative with energetic episodes and clever lines. There's an invigorating honesty in the way the couple discuss love and the twist in the pre-climax saunters in slickly. The build-up to the climax, coupled with the mature execution of the written material, keeps you hooked. On the flip side, the writing meanders from stimulating to wishy-washy. There are times when the film tries to be different from movies of its ilk, but doesn't really thrive. Sure, it begins with a bang, but it continues to taper as it moves forward. The director uses melodrama to depict anxiety and trauma, but the trouble is, haven't we watched it all in movies earlier? The DoP [Manush Nandan] endeavors for a certain look and feel and which he maintains all through. The stunning locales of Paris and Prague augment the visual impact. The soundtrack [Sajid-Wajid] is wholesome, with the composers coming up with tracks that capture the mood of the love story. 'It's All About Tonight' is racy, while 'Kudiye Di Kurti' is foot-tapping and the presence of Salman Khan acts as the icing on the cake. 'Saiyaan' is melodious to the core. It's difficult to take your eyes off Preity and Rhehan. Whether bickering or flirting with one another, the actors catch your eye in those tiny little moments that capture their charming chemistry well. What makes the performances work is that the characters are bona fide and credible. Preity is exquisite in every frame. Her eyes emanate genuine warmth and her performance is captivating. It's great to see this supremely talented actress back in top form! Rhehan too infuses energy into his role and compliments Preity at every level. He looks perfect for his part and carries his part with poise and composure. Isabelle Adjani is good enough in the few sequences she appears in. Sanjay Lafont doesn't get scope. Shekhar Kapur shines in the song-sequence. Chunky Pandey is up to the mark in a cameo. On the whole, ISHKQ IN PARIS is a decent fare, but its fate depends on word of mouth completely, for the film to carve a niche for itself. The delay in release [the promos had been on air for quite some time] coupled with lack of strong face-value might mar its prospects!</Review>

This one line brief has resulted in so many engaging love stories, that I went in a tad hopeful. This was, after all, Paris and Preity, a city with magic and a girl with sparkle. Who knew what that combo may yield? Sadly, Ishkq In Paris comes off mostly derivative, and wholly predictable. Preity plays Ishkq (yes, that's her name) who lives in Paris with her beautiful French mum (Adjani). She's the kind of girl who thinks nothing of taking off for a weekend to Rome because she 'loves being served by Italian waiters'. She wants to have fun but is commitment phobic. Which seems just such a perfect fit with Akash (Malliek), who is exactly the same. Their meanderings around dim-lit strangely-empty Parisian cafes and streets, with the mandatory Eiffel Tower moment, are filled with chatter, all very Before Sunrise. Some of that yakkity-yak is dotted with a few funny lines; you smile. And then you stop. Because soon enough, all the clich�s that you can think of start popping up, and it all becomes downbeat. Ishkq is the way she is not because that's who she is. The poor thing has daddy issues. Dear old daddy (Kapur, looking grizzled in a tiny cameo) left her and mum, see? Which leads to abandonment issues. If daddy scarpered, so will Akash, won't he? So on and so forth. There's even a cloudburst that accompanies an emotional blow-out between Ishqk and Akash: you know, the kind that used to happen in the movies of yore where the rain-water mingled with the heroine's tears. Remind me again, we are in 2013, yes? Preity still looks as if she could be on the big screen (not just on TV as a harried IPL team owner defending greedy players), but in a role that lets her be truer. Which she could easily have done, as the screenplay credits her. Malliek has the better lines, but doesn't lift as much as he could have, especially as the second half gets progressively soggier. Getting the gorgeous Adjani to play Preity's mom must have been a coup, but should have had better results: the two look as if they could be mother and daughter, but end up exchanging dialogues, merely. This is Preity Zinta's own production, and she could have created for herself a character that would have hewed closer to where she is right now. There are moments where you feel she was ready for it, and then the desperate-to-come-off-winsome-yet-vulnerable character takes over. So does the mandatory item number, featuring the one and only Salman Khan.</Review>

There is a moment in the film when the protagonist looks at a TV screen showing one of the most devastating moments of this century, and his instant reaction is horror mixed with, yes, stunned admiration. The response is involuntary. What audacity, he thinks, and the voice over lets us into his thoughts. The image is that of the twin towers under attack in Manhattan, those planes crashing, that leaping fire: the film takes us elsewhere after this, but those of us who saw those same images on the screen in real time, have an indelible spot in our eyes, and how the world changed, post 9/11. This mixed reaction and the voicing of it is the central triumph of Mira Nair's The Reluctant Fundamentalist, based on the novel of the same name by Mohsin Hamid (the author shares screenplay credit, too). It comes from Changez Khan (Ahmed), a young Pakistani who realizes his American dream is a bubble, that he is not and never will be an American despite his fancy Ivy League degree and his earning capacity of those coveted greenbacks via his employment at one of the most prestigious firms on Wall Street. As far as America goes after the attacks of 9/11, and that's not very far at all, the brown-skinned, possibly-bearded Changez is and will always remain a suspicious person, who will always be asked to "step aside, sir" at an immigration queue. As far as America is concerned, Changez will always be a potential terrorist. The place that he reaches, instead, as a 'reluctant fundamentalist,' is where the film falters, and adopts some of the stiltedness of Hamid's slim novel. The tacked-on staginess is Nair's, and it is most evident in the movie's book-ends, if you like. The beginning and the end take place in Lahore, where Changez has engaged his visitor, the blue-eyed, straw-haired husky American Bobby (Schreiber) in a conversation that loops back and forth in time, over tea and old fashioned Lahori courtesy laced with menace. This is where the 'thriller' part of the film is meant to be concentrated, and this is where it gets flabby, focusing on a kidnap-and-rescue operation which ends badly. But where Nair is deliciously spot on is when Changez, hopeful of a great future in the US, takes his first tentative steps into his workplace and, almost simultaneously, a life-altering romance. His interactions with his boss (Sutherland) show us a bright sharp young fellow who could have fit right into the cut- throat practice of making people redundant. But his tentative steps towards finding the love of his life in Erica (Hudson) makes him more aware: he sees both sides of his self, and finds he is not in step with the country that could have been home. Nair's film speaks to the complicated times we live in, in the way it shows us an America whose own responses went into a tailspin after the Twin Towers came down: either you were with them in their 'war against terror' or you were against them. Changez's very reluctant fundamentalist shows that there is a place in between that is getting larger and larger, and that both victims and aggressors are people with their own sets of beliefs. The films that have come out post-9/11 have been many and various, but Changez's conflicted individual at the centre of the narrative feels both vital and important. Ahmed does a good job of Changez, especially when he is alongside Hudson who is real and hurtful and hurting. He has pride but he is contained in America, and liberated in Lahore. Or is he? And she, still smarting from the wounds of the past, if she will not find love with Changez, will she ever? I was invested in these characters. I wanted to know what happens to them. The presence of Shabana and Om lift The Reluctant Fundamentalist in the way only supremely seasoned actors can: as Changez's Ammi and Abbu, they give us a sense of where he comes from. And the sounds of Coke Studio Pakistan that layer the film are outstanding: Nair has always had a ear for music, and here those sounds really add to the experience. The film could have done with more finesse in the way it begins and ends, but there are enough subtle shifts in the main act to keep me with it. After Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is Nair's most engaging work.</Review>

An Ivy-leaguer, he is a successful financial consultant who has everything going for him in the land of opportunity. Then he witnesses 9/11. And Changez begins to hate America. Not because he interprets the act as some subliminal belief he had within him all along, but rather, for what America does to him after. And now, the CIA want him. Mira Nair does a great service to The Reluctant Fundamentalist, the Mohsin Hamid book - a listless series of familiar observations and endless allegories - by directing with considerable gusto and breathing life into the source material about a young man caught in an ideological crossfire of two cultures. She starts by making it a thriller of sorts, introducing an element of a race against time to keep the frame story engaging. But the pace becomes sluggish, picking up in the second half only to fizzle out in the climax again as the FBI-in-Pak angle ends up having nothing to do with what the film is trying to say. TRF's strength lies in individual scenes, the ones that are more dramatic and telling than others though often operating with subtext alone. Changez is outraged at his girlfriend's Islam-America hybrid themed art show that she exclaims is an expression of love. He is hurt and lashes out in the cruelest way and ends up alienating his only confidante. Changez's moments of reflection in Istanbul after a gentle but deeply scathing insight from the publisher of a firm he is there to fire, is superbly effective. "You're the son of poet?" asks the publisher, "you should be ashamed of yourself." That's when Changez realises that there is no poetry in his life. He is nothing but a mercenary, a cog in the economic house of cards that is America. He takes irreversible decisions to correct that. Here, Nair chooses a few of the allegories from the book with care and keeps them intact. The one about the janissaries of the Ottoman empire have considerable impact on Changez. That and the one about the senior financial consultant and terror recruiter echoing each other's catchphrase. About sticking to the 'fundamentals'. TRF is wonderfully shot even though you can clearly tell Delhi is substituted for not only Lahore but other places as well. Production design, however, does a super cover-up job with immaculate attention to detail. Even though it has been well over a decade, The Reluctant Fundamentalist still has relevance. It says things the west needs to hear. I hope they do, I hope they get it. On this count, as a thought, Mira Nair could not have chosen a better subject. I suspect the subject chose her, really. But perhaps it is too subtle for this intention and will be far better understood in South Asia. Unfortunately, we already know all of this.</Review>

One was that irony was dead. How, after this apocalypse, could irony reveal or explain American life and culture, critics asked. Mohsin Hamid�s best-selling book The Reluctant Fundamentalist which came came out six years after the apocalypse had somehow proved the culture critics right. It�s a book where two men are talking, each from two sharply demarcated worlds, and with contrary points of view. The Islam-versus-West dialogue went no further than where it had stood stagnant after 9/11. Hamid�s prose has a breezy pace, albeit without sharply observed details or complexity in characterization. Mira Nair�s film version exactly replicates the book. Besides Declan Quinn�s cinematography which captures New York as well as Lahore robustly, in all their details, without fixing his gaze on the obvious, and some competent performances, the story itself has insufficient potential to be explored visually. How do you translate ideological bookkeeping on screen�especially, when the ideologies on display finally has no real guts or extremism,and tethers on an acceptable brand of liberal humanism. Hamid has co-written the �screen story�, later developed into a screenplay by William Wheeler. Changhez Khan (Riz Ahmed) is a professor in Lahore. The FBI sees him as an ally of violent fundamentalist forces because of his popularity. So when Bobby (Liev Schreiber), a journalist, meets him to find the �truth�, a dialogue between the two unfolds, the crux of which is: Are global capitalism and Islamist ideas of patriotism irreconcilable? photo Kate Hudson and Riz Ahmed in a scene from the movie In flashback, Changhez is a financial analyst at a leading corporation in New York. His family (which includes Om Puri as his father and Shabana Azmi as his mother) is mockingly disdainful of his profession, but Changhez is sold. He is the bright star inside Manhattan glass towers. The American canons of opportunity, enterprise and reward define most of him. Changhez meets a conceptual artist (Kate Hudson) who is grappling with a personal loss, and falls deeply in love with her. He is his boss�s (Kiefer Sutherland) favourite and his rise in the ranks is unstoppable, when the twin towers are attacked. The political begins to impinge on the personal. He feels alienated and angry�his immediate reaction of being awed by the sheer scale of the attack, as opposed to the politically correct outrage and grief which all of America is feeling at that time, making him the distinct �other� in that polarised world. Changhez quits his job and returns to Lahore. As he recounts his story to Bobby, it is unclear what really is his defence for being what he is. Changhez is lost in the obvious, humdrum rationality of his lines. The white woman is a cardboard character�the black hair can�t overcome the superficiality with which she is portrayed. More a prop to propel Changhez�s journey rather than a fully-realized woman, Hudson has no material to work on her role. Ahmed is an extremely skilled actor and the character�s earnestness and seriousness reveal without any efforts showing. Earlier, he played the comic version of a similar character in the low-budget Four Lions, to which, perhaps, he brought more novelty and force. Technically, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is accomplished. The editing by Shimit Amin is evident not in the film�s length, but more in the details of how the rich visuals and music complement each other. This is a timeline that has inspired some important films. Take the most recent film, Kathryn Bigelow�s tight thriller, Zero Dark Thirty. It looks at the post 9/11-world through the American military prism scathingly. Most films have the American point of view. So despite the wishy-washy point of view, The Reluctant Fundamentalist earns posterity. Nair shows the discrimination that Changhez faces, and the hostility against South Asian Muslims so common at that time, without holding back. These scenes are a faithful visual record of what went into post-9/11 racial profiling in America. So Nair�s reputation as a culture-clash specialist�based not so much on her best work, but in her choice of subjects and the way the film-making world sees her today�is more firmly entrenched after this film.</Review>

      <Review Id="229" Name="Sukanya Verma" Expected="" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-aurangzeb/20130517.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="17 May, 2013" Likes="" Rating="3/5">Aurangzeb is primarily about inheritance of character from parent to child. And the opening underlines this theme with a quote from Roman poet Horace, �Deep in the cavern of the infant�s breast; the father�s nature lurks, and lives anew.� What lends its sentimentality a crooked twist is how its premise is relentlessly influenced by the cutthroat philosophy of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Director Atul Sabharwal tackles the conflicting interests of conscience and conditioning with his robustly executed first film for Yash Raj. Against the relevant backdrop of land-grabbing in Gurgaon and its deep-rooted network within corporate sectors, political parties and corrupt law and order, Sabharwal weaves an old-fashioned yarn about family -- both close-knit and estranged. On one hand there�s a family of cops -- Ravikant (Rishi Kapoor), his nephew Arya (Prithviraj Sukumaran) and son Dev (Sikander Kher). The stern, resentful Arya models himself along the lines of the supremely assertive Ravikant as opposed to his long disgraced, defeated father (Anupam Kher).   Meanwhile, Yashwardhan (Jackie Shroff) is a successful tycoon running illegal industries, masked under the impression of his authorised businesses, assisted by the sharp Neena (Amrita Singh). He has given up on making sense of his brash son, Ajay (Arjun Kapoor), the proverbial cad whiling away his time partying with/beating up his annoyingly compliant girlfriend, Ritu (Sasheh Agha). Light-eyed Agha, no matter how much (and frequently) she exposes, cannot distract the viewer from her serious lack of talent and feeble screen presence. Her so-called intense scenes with Kapoor are plain comical and completely dampen the screenplay. She fares better in the recording studio though with her spunky rendition of Barbaadiyan.     But this is only maybe five minutes of Aurangzeb, which starts off a tad synthetic with dialogues sounding like quotation books instead of conversation. The real discord begins after Arya discovers Ajay�s lookalike, Vishal (Kapoor) and plants him in Ajay�s place to collect evidence against Yashwardhan in the backdrop of Gurgaon�s glossy landscapes (with surreal shots of its bokeh-lit traffic by N Karthik Ganesh). There�s a dramatic twist here ( which I am obviously not going to reveal) that ensures Aurangzeb doesn�t draw too many comparisons from the likes of The Departed, The Devil�s Double or even Don. (Though there is moment that squeals Skyfall whereas the background score is reminiscent of The Dark Knight Rises.) Deeply derivative of the traditional Hindi film narrative where blood-ties gain precedence over individual turbulence, Aurangzeb works even in its inept form. Because, one, Sabharwal constructs a compelling, intricate conspiracy of deceit and motive around predominantly grey characters, where chances are anyone can turn a volte face, for better or worse. And because Aurangzeb�s momentum is steady and swift, the loopholes are skilfully minimised even if only temporarily. So, sure, you do wonder about the loosely established relationships, convenient set-ups and undisclosed footage of significant reactions, but much later. Interestingly, Aurangzeb doesn�t demonstrate any depth to examine the impact of role-playing, and change in circumstances on Arjun Kapoor�s psyche but both -- Prithviraj (by way of voiceover that offers a constant peek into his thoughts) and Rishi Kapoor (his candid conversation with Deepti Naval showing his innermost anxieties to his frighteningly supportive partner) -- emerge as the more fleshed-out characters of this stylish drama.    This brings us to the second and most stealing aspect of Aurangzeb -- its casting (Shanoo Sharma). Prithviraj Sukumaran�s clean-cut persona stands out in a role that demands subtle cynicism, restrained force, suppressed emotionality and dry humour. Rishi Kapoor is at the top of his game and inspires awe through the stunning curve he draws within the story. To rave any more could lead to revelations that are best enjoyed on one�s own. The other Kapoor, Arjun shows remarkable poise and volume in his second film and first double role in the company of stalwarts. Though it could have been a far better written part, especially Ajay, he consciously maintains a distinction between the twain. It's also great to see Jackie Shroff render the proceedings his characteristic charisma, warmth and grit in a somewhat neglected role. None of the senior girls -- Amrita Singh, Deepti Naval and Tanvi Azmi -- are moulded in pure convention and make a statement with their fiercely kohl-ed eyes and sturdy point of views. Sadly, in the case of their junior colleagues, Agha doesn�t have the potential while Swara Bhaskar isn�t given enough scope to bite. Whether all kids inherit their parents� moral temperament I do not know but where Bollywood is concerned, its conditioning on filmmakers is undeniable. And going by what the inspired but engaging Aurangzeb has to offer, it�s not such a bad thing.</Review>
      <Review Id="230" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/review-aurangzeb/1117128/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="17 May, 2013" Likes="5" Rating="2/5">Somewhere in the too-complicated strands of Aurangzeb is a film struggling to cohere. This is what we have: too many subplots with threads hanging, criss-crossing a main plot that is over baked and undercooked. A nephew (Prithivraj) brought up by his chacha (Rishi) as he has serious problems with his loser father (Kher). Identical twins separated as babies, now grown into very different individuals (Arjun). Long suffering mother (Azmi) buffeted between the two. Filthy rich businessman (Shroff) with corrupt practices. Greedy female associate (Amrita Singh) with sharp claws. Good cops, bad cops. All roiling in Bollywood's new Wild West�the National Capital Region of Gurgaon. The trouble with Aurangzeb is not that it isn't ambitious. It is, and that's good. Because after a long time there's a film which invites you to work on unraveling the threads. But right from its too-crowded epilogue, where information about the characters comes flying out at you, to its curiously impact-less lead player who sparks to life on occasion, to its long-drawn scenes where sometimes you feel the lines are being said only for effect and not because they have organically grown out of the conversation, Aurangzeb is trying for too much. This makes the film dense and uneven: some parts have power, the others are inert. These locations in Gurgaon haven't been heavily exposed yet, but this mix of the builder mafia and collusive cops and poor farmers have a familiar ring to it. The view of the ultra-modern Metro cutting across a rapidly growing township which has both the feel of mall-and-multiplex American suburbia and empty stretches of agricultural land gives Aurangzeb its distinctive look. You wish more juice had come out of the sharp contrast, though. This is Arjun Kapoor's second film, and he is already in a double role. Ajay and Vishal may look alike, but one is nice and sensitive, the other is brash and crass (a bit like his character in his debut Ishaqzaade): Kapoor is more in synch with the second avatar. More effective than him, and in fact all the other good actors in this film, is Rishi Kapoor. As the policeman who will be king, who has not one soft shred in his hard, hard head, and who will kill a close relative rather than be caught on the wrong foot, Kapoor is terrific. It's also nice to have Amrita Singh back amongst us even if her role is constricted. After flashing his beautifully muscled abs, Prithviraj has a fully-fleshed part: this is an actor whom I want see more of. There's also a debutant with an interesting lineage: Sasha Agha daughter of Salma (remember her?), and appears promising. There is no doubt that Sabharwal has a voice, which is evident in the less constructed parts of Aurangzeb. Maybe it will emerge fully with his second film.</Review>

He introduces his "business" as a top cop and the roll of characters that are to play a part in this complex, intelligent plot that holds the promise of a taut thriller about power and money. At a thematic level, the writers have invested a lot in the screenplay. This is not merely a story of good vs evil for shades of grey overwhelm. There is a delicate web of characters, who are always expected to double cross and have their moments of epiphanies that bring about a 180-degree turn in their conduct. And they don't disappoint. Every ancillary player has more to them than meets the eye. The underworld is white-collared, sans sleaze and more corporate than even the corporates we're used to in Bollywood. The authorities have extensive, even human, backgrounds that motivate their every move. They both lack conscience, and are willing to pay any price for their goals. They're at loggerheads but it's impossible to pick a side. You must instead back characters, who may or may not be redeemed. A film that makes you do this is a good film. But at its heart, Aurangzeb is about family dominated by a parent-son theme. Blood and ambition, the film often reminds us, are the choices the characters of Aurangzeb have before them. And while the movie succeeds at a thematic level, it falters with the details. Critical plot points are weakly executed. The crisis upfront that forces a Don-like potentially dangerous exchange of twins separated in their youth (I say these words without irony) is justified almost offhandedly - to restore a dead man's honour. In the climax too, equations change faster than you can say "traitor" because a mobile phone voice message mistakenly records a critical exchange leading to murder. Feeble, for a story with such ambition. Sabharwal is unable to maintain the authoritative control he has over the proceedings in the first quarter of Aurangzeb. He begins to idiot-proof the story and resorts to gimmicky drama as it begins to slip away from the viewer. As it is, the idea of lookalikes taking another, more powerful person's place has always been purely a cinematic trick and one on shaky ground. Imagine for a moment you had a doppelganger and s/he was thrust all of a sudden amongst your closest people, in real life. Would they for a moment believe it was you? Very few films can pull such a thing off convincingly. And the one that come instantly to mind is The Talented Mr Ripley. Arjun Kapoor though is earnest with his effort in this difficult double role. This is a performance more mature than what we saw of him in Ishaqzaade. He's particularly good when unrestrained, and seems to relish playing the bad boy. A special mention for Jackie Shroff, who's reinvented himself post his fine work in Aaranya Kaandam. There's gravity in his voice. When he speaks, you listen. While the ambition of Aurangzeb is to be lauded, there just isn't enough steam to see it through till the end. And at well over two hours, that end seems very far off. Try it then, for its complexity and Kapoor and Shroff.</Review>

You have a cracker of an idea, the build up is great too, and then gross lack of imagination turns everything into a mangled mess post interval. We've seen it happen too often in Bollywood. Add Aurangzeb to the list. Atul Sabharwal's debut directorial feature tries reorganising quite a few Bollywood cliches to suit new-age tastes, yet retaining familiar flavours. Cops and goons, long-lost twins, the angry young man, bombastic dialogues and the filmy underworld get a tweak as old-school masala tries blending with mainstream's newfound fetish for realism. Any resemblance Aurangzeb bears with Don and Trishul is perhaps absolutely intended. Sabharwal, though, was not out to rehash either pop classic. He merely borrows basic plot points from these films to set up his own tale where violence, emotion, suspense, machismo and deceit jostle for screenplay space. The plot is simple. Cops have forever been trying to nail Gurgaon real estate kingpin Yashvardhan (Jackie Shroff) without success. They just fail to get enough evidence against the man every time. Yashvardhan's top gun is the dapper Ajay (Arjun), a gangster whose lust for power knows no bounds. Then, top cop Ravikant (Rishi Kapoor) unearths a secret about Yashvardhan and hits upon a plan. Ajay is captured and the cops plant his lookalike Vishal (Arjun in a double role) in his place, as an informer in Yashvardhan's world. Okay, there is a twist in the story. It seems influenced by the ruthless Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (hence the film's title). The twist is also meant to heighten the drama in the later portions and also lead to a gripping finale. But that never quite happens. Aurangzeb fumbles due to weak writing and an almost stubborn urge to adhere to formula. Watch out for Arjun Kapoor, Ishaqzaade was just a sneak peek. In Aurangzeb, Arjun serves up his double whammy well, finely demarcating the character traits of Ajay and Vishal. He needs more polish with skills of emoting, though. To Sabharwal's credit, he has assorted the finest possible prop cast. Rishi Kapoor and Prithviraj leave a solid impact. Rishi, as an aging officer who will go to any manipulative extent to get what he wants, gives the film its sinister edge. Jackie Shroff, returning after a while as a don who will fall from grace, adds a certain gravitas to his role. Bollywood gets an add-on in its rank of hotties with Sasheh Aagha, introduced here as the traditional heroine. Salma Agha's daughter isn't having a remarkable debut with this film. Her presence is merely meant to tweak the film's oomph quota. Bikini, bedroom and booty shake are the buzzwords that pretty much sum it up for her. After all, what is a masala action flick without the staple sex kitten.</Review>

There are two infants in question in Aurangzeb �identical twins who have been separated at birth. One has evolved into a swaggering brat who has never handled a shaving blade or seen the insides of a hair-cutting salon. The other is on standby, waiting to be inserted into the story. And there are at least three fathers�a gangster who is moving aggressively into the construction business in Gurgaon, an honest cop, and a corrupt cop who sets the whole thing into motion when he swaps the good egg for the bad one. By replacing Ajay (Arjun Kapoor) with his brother Vishal, Ravikant (Rishi Kapoor) cements his cinephiliac credentials. Like the duplicates in Shakti Samanta�s China Town (1962), Subhash Ghai�s Kalicharan (1976) and Chandra Barot�s Don (1978), Vishal effortlessly slides into his new role. The small-town boy makes a butter-smooth entry into a world of big money and powerful players. His father Yashvardhan (Jackie Shroff) doesn�t notice that his son is no longer rude and violent. Yashvardhan�s scheming and sharp-eyed mistress (Amrita Singh), who wants to run her own empire, misses the transformation. Ajay�s girlfriend Ritu (Sasha Agha) wakes up to the deception only after her otherwise testosterone-influenced boyfriend slips under the sheets with her. There is a potentially fantastic morning-after sequence here, but Sabharwal passes on the opportunity. The action is largely driven by Ravikant, who plots away with the finesse of a dimestore novelist and get his dirty work done by his son Dev (Sikandar Kher) and nephew Arya (Prithviraj Sukumaran), who has a connection with the twins. The moral centre, inevitably, is located in the widowed mother (Tanvi Azmi, stepping into the slippers of Nirupa Roy and Waheeda Rehman). The convolutions and contrivances in Sabharwal�s screenplay lead to yet another inevitability�a Mexican-style shootout in which everybody points guns at everybody else and 80 % of the cast conveniently gets blown off the screen. Although there is never a dull moment in the lives of the characters, the 140-minute movie curiously lacks momentum. The Gurgaon setting holds immense promise, but it isn�t deployed in the screenplay in any effective way. The family-economy-industry-politics cocktail was mixed far better by Shyam Benegal in Kalyug (1981). The performances are strictly serviceable. Arjun Kapoor�s rawness is all too evident, but he fares marginally better than Prithviraj Sukumaran, who provides the voiceover and disgorges chunks of Hindi dialogue with a discernible Malayali accent. The title is supposed to work as a metaphor, in the same way as the Hollywood film Chinatown (1974) and Shanghai (2012) are about abstract ideas (falsehood and aspiration respectively) rather than actual places. Aurangzeb is about inheritance, and it initially seems that Sabharwal might be able to bring new ideas to the clich� that blood is thicker than water. His movie is spilling over with characters that conform to the popular stereotype of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb�a ruthless and power-hungry maniac whose path to the throne is littered with the bodies of family members and acquaintances. The battleground is transported into a boardroom, and a bottomed-out war chest becomes a loss-making balance sheet. This is a movie that aspires to be about the mini-empires that exist within�and often work against�the Indian republic, but it scuttles its own ambitions midway through. It becomes yet another movie about twins separated by circumstance and brought together by Hindi cinema.</Review>

Unfortunately, while the 70s storyline demanded melodrama, the treatment here is very contemporary and the drama is largely subtle and underplayed. And in this unusual and seemingly incompatible fusion, Aurangzeb loses its authority. More than Trishul (as is the popular perception), Aurangzeb derives from Don. Ajay and Vishal (Arjun Kapoor in a double role) are twins separated at birth. Vishal has stayed back with his mother while Ajay has turned the debauched son of his millionaire father, Yashwardhan (Jackie Shroff), who runs his illegal activities under the guise of a respected businessman. Senior police officials (Rishi Kapoor and Prithviraj) get Vishal to take place of his unknowing twin brother Ajay and penetrate Yashwardhan's illegal operations. The basic plot of a cop infiltrating into a criminal nexus seems like a prehistoric premise today. Further his identification with the criminal more than the cops has also been done-to-death ever since Donnie Brasco days. In Aurangzeb, writer-director Atul Sabharwal attempts to add a family backdrop and make the story more rooted and dramatic. However the narrative is too tame and predictable. The double role element that the film employs is neither explored to the hilt nor does it add too much value or variation. While the twin brothers are supposed to be two diverse characters thanks to their different upbringing, we see the film largely through the eyes of Ajay and then Vishal posing as Ajay. Vishal adapts into being Ajay too conveniently, while Ajay who is under house-arrest has pretty much nothing to do. The narrative momentarily shines in the second half when the villains suddenly switch over. Sabharwal intentionally chooses a particular restrained treatment for his film which reflects in everything from the slow pacing, minimal use of background score and brooding yet underplayed acts. Even the dialogues are well-worded but not punctuated with theatrics. Such subtlety does set the film apart and is often laudable in modern times. However the problem here is that since there isn't enough meat in the movie per se, perhaps some more drama could have covered up the shallowness of the story. Moreover, with the conventional climax, the graph only dips further. Despite playing a double role, Arjun Kapoor doesn't get enough scope to bring distinction to his two characters (beyond his fluctuating facial hair). However, the actor doesn't disappoint and adds the requisite intensity to his role. Prithviraj has good screen presence and is confident in his part. Jackie Shroff seems tired and doesn't get much scope in the second half. Rishi Kapoor is quite commendable, though, and makes his character rise much above the script. Sasha Aagha fills up the glamour quotient. Amrita Singh starts off fairly well but loses steam subsequently. Sikander Kher suffers from a half-baked character. Aurangzeb had the potential to be a much better film. Alas it only comes across as a TV serial sans the melodrama!</Review>

So much so, that to satisfy their gun-toting fantasies they can weave silly screenplays into movie projects. Debutant director Atul Sabharwal is guilty of such indulgence. Aurangzeb, with a mammoth dose of testosterone, is a half-baked gangster fantasy. Oh it doesn�t help when the poster of the film promotes Arjun Kapoor as the leading man. But the narrative makes Prithviraj, who plays a cop, the hero. For good measure there are two Arjun Kapoors. Yes there�s the adage, �the more the merrier� but just because there are two avatars of the same actor, doesn�t make him the hero. Nonetheless, the film uses the story of Aurangzeb (the Mughal Emperor) as a metaphor for gangsta land mythos. The edgy and violent Arjun Kapoor (Ajay) is the son of a feared mafia head. Jackie Shroff as Yashwardhan is that fearful mob boss. His name strikes terror in the hearts of all those who live in Gurgaon. But Yashwardhan is actually a seminal businessman who values his clientele above all. So much so, he has friendly lunches with ordinary farmers and hands them bags full of money. Aren�t dreaded gangsters supposed to steal money? Nevertheless, his totally wonky son Ajay likes to pick a fight and treat women like shit. Amrita Singh plays Leela, Yashwardhan�s business associate with ulterior motives. And you should hear Ajay bad-mouthing Leela on her face. No wonder Delhi has such a bad reputation of being woman unfriendly. The other Arjun Kapoor (Vishal) is put in place of Ajay with the motive of bringing down Yashwardhan�s criminal empire. Sort of like Vibhishan did with Ravana in the Ramayana. Now we�re just mixing metaphors. Despite not being the �technical� hero of the film, Arjun Kapoor is the best thing about Aurangzeb. His performance in a double role reminds of you all those Amitabh Bachchan movies from the �80s where Mr Bachchan became a staple action genre favourite. Arjun excels in both the edgy avatar of Ajay and the more resolved and subtle character of Vishal. It�s a pity that the narrative keeps jumping away from his characters� dramatic arcs. Prithviraj gives a commendable performance as well. He does a good job at masking his South accent but it does show in some places. Rishi Kapoor adds a menacing touch to his role. He�s a good guy and a bad guy and leave it to the veteran actor to ace a complex performance. Aurangzeb would�ve done well had it built upon the Gurgaon premise. One where a growing city becomes a natural habitat for urban and organised crime. In fact, the movie packs quite a dramatic punch in scenes where the police become the grey force of this story. But right at the end it all goes South. Prithviraj miraculously pulls off a coup where he and the two Arjun Kapoors manage to bump off all the bad guys without even getting seriously injured. Sasheh Agha, the heroine of the movie, is practically nonexistent in the scheme of the film. If she�s the female lead, she should�ve had more to do than just don a bikini and make love to the hero. Sadly, Aurangzeb isn�t the bad movie that�s so bad it becomes good. It�s an average gangster movie that packs low on action ammunition and high on predictable double crosses and character developments. This could�ve been a Devil�s Double meets Goodfellas meets The Departed. But it isn�t.</Review>

Only big banners can pull off such a feat. But what gets disappointing is when such big banners itself end up wasting their resources over substandard scripts that fail to please anybody. Yash Raj Film's Aurangzeb is a case of such mediocrity. Ajay and Vishal (Arjun Kapoor) are twin brothers separated by birth. While Vishal gets taken away by the mother (Tanvi Azmi) Ajay gets left behind with Yashvardhan (Jackie Shroff) who under the garb of being a real estate tycoon runs an a huge nexus of illegal activities only to turn into a depraved person. DCP Ravikant (Rishi Kapoor) uncle of ACP Arya (Prithviraj Sukumaran) are both corrupt and call themselves collecting agents come across Vishal and replace him with Ajay to bust Yashvardhan's racket. Whether the estranged son turns his father's empire to ruins or not follows through the rest of the plot. Contrary to the popular perception, Aurangzeb turns out to be more of Amitabh Bachchan's Don than Trishul only in the shoddier manner. What looks good on papers needn't necessarily be good onscreen too. Debutant filmmaker Atul Sabharwal takes up a script of gargantuan proportions and mercilessly botches it up. The film had ample scope to turn into an engaging affair with ample twists and turns but what it turns out instead is a hackneyed 70's rip off. The concept of twin swapping, illegitimate sons, revenge etc. appears extremely jaded and also gets a trite treatment. The basic turn of events in the story get revealed within the first few minutes of the film where the filmmaker conveniently turns his characters the way he wants. So you see a man raised under secured and cushioned upbringing agreeing to get into a risky zone only to bring back his foster father's lost pride. You also see the change of hearts of many characters from negative to positive and positive to negative purely over the filmmaker's whims and fancies which make the film hard to believe. The twists and turns by the end of the film become so ordinary that you stop applying your brains over the pointlessly convoluted plot and let the proceedings unfurl in front of your eyes. To make the story worse you also get timely Maa ka melodrama and rona dhona. If Aurangzeb holds any merit it's only in the acting. The filmmaker succeeds in extracting power-packed performances by veteran actors Rishi Kapoor and Jackie Shroff. South import Prithviraj Sukumaran rids himself of all the mother tongue influence and delivers his dialogues perfectly. His acting also is top notch. The main star of the film Arjun Kapoor does a double whammy. Although he doesn't get much scope to accentuate the personalities of both his characters but even in his limited part he plays it impressively. Sikander Berry (Kirron Kher's son) gets wasted and the same is the case with all the ladies of the film. Right from Tanvi Azmi to Amrita Singh to also the debutant Sasheh Agha all get typecast in their tripe characters. To sum it up, Aurangzeb is a cliched formulaic drama straight out of the '70s era that fails to impress the audience.</Review>

Recall HUM DONO [Dev Anand], RAM AUR SHYAM [Dilip Kumar], DO KALIYAN [Neetu Singh], ARADHANA [Rajesh Khanna], SEETA AUR GEETA [Hema Malini], MAUSAM [Sharmila Tagore], DON [Amitabh Bachchan], AAKHREE RAASTA [Amitabh Bachchan], CHAALBAAZ [Sridevi], KISHEN KANHAIYA [Anil Kapoor], JUDWAA [Salman Khan], KAHO NAA... PYAAR HAI [Hrithik Roshan], DON [Shah Rukh Khan], ROWDY RATHORE [Akshay Kumar]... the protagonist in those movies left an indelible impression on cineastes. Now Arjun Kapoor gets to portray a double role very early in his career... in his second film itself -- AURANGZEB. Rumors are rife that AURANGZEB is the present-day version of Yash Chopra's immensely likable TRISHUL. With modifications of course, to suit the present-day sensibilities. Much earlier, when YRF unveiled the promo of the film, the comparisons with Chandra Barot's DON had gathered momentum. So what's the truth? Well, AURANGZEB does bring back memories of TRISHUL as well as DON, but the premise, setting and execution are poles apart. AURANGZEB, a crime drama, focuses on the land mafia and the enmity between two authoritative factions: Police and mafia. The film marks the big screen debut of Atul Sabharwal, who directed a crime show [POWDER] for Yash Raj's television unit. The director knows the technicalities right, but he falters -- and falters big time -- in narrating a gripping story in a concise format. Resultantly, the film tests the patience of the spectator in the second hour and the impact of several brilliant moments gets washed away in the process. A family of policemen... A family of gangsters... Under the guise of a respected citizen, Yashwardhan [Jackie Shroff], runs a parallel world, a world where he is the Emperor. To bring down a criminal, the law will have to now think like a criminal! When Vishal [Arjun Kapoor] is planted in Yashwardhan's world in place of Ajay [Arjun Kapoor], the lawmakers [Rishi Kapoor and Prithviraj] roll the dice and a sequence of events unravel something much more than what Vishal bargained for, as he finds himself in a predicament that puts him to test! AURANGZEB catches your eye initially. There are numerous characters in this cat and mouse saga and the storytelling, although slow-paced, keeps the spectator glued to the proceedings. Atul, who has also penned the screenplay, focuses on drama more than action/violence and the back story of the prominent characters as well as the menacing games they indulge in results in an invigorating first hour. Atul makes sure he packages the narrative well with moments that, although predictable at times, stay with you. Like most Hindi movies, AURANGZEB suffers from the curse of the second hour syndrome, for the film languishes and fumbles soon after the intermission. There are too many issues, frankly. First and foremost, the drama loses sheen as it proceeds. Two, the drama seems never-ending and with too many characters and too many things happening in the movie, what comes across is a hodgepodge. Even the culmination fails to give you a high. Adding to the woes is its lethargic pacing! To give the credit where it's due, Atul handles the dramatic moments adroitly, but the effort to cram too many characters and episodes in the screenplay hits the second hour of the film hard. Dialogue, so crucial in a film that has drama as its core selling point, is punch-packed at times, but commonplace otherwise. There's no scope for music here and the absence of a popular score too is a deterrent. The film is well shot, with the DoP [N. Karthik Ganesh] filming the outdoors with flourish. Rishi Kapoor is the lifeline of the enterprise. He charms his way into the spectator's minds with a spectacular performance. It's a delight to watch Jackie Shroff and Amrita Singh, a popular pair of the 1980s, after a hiatus in dominant parts. Jackie excels in his role, although he is sidelined subsequently. Amrita is super in a role that demands a scheming and manipulating woman. Arjun Kapoor, who impressed critics and moviegoers alike in his debut film, gets to portray dual roles. The wild child is reminiscent of the part he portrayed in ISHAQZAADE, but the second role is sober and subdued. The youngster attempts to balance the dissimilar parts deftly, but falters in emotional moments. Newcomer Sasheh Agha gets to depict several bold scenes in her debut film and the newcomer seems quite comfortable and confident doing those. Prithviraj, who debuted on the Hindi screen with AIYYAA, gets a meatier part this time, but the challenge lies in convincing the spectator that he looks his part of a North Indian. It's evident that the talented actor has polished his diction and speaks his lines effortlessly. Otherwise too, his performance is effectual. Deepti Naval is wasted. Ditto for Anupam Kher. Tanvi Azmi is efficient. Swara Bhaskar is limited to a few scenes. Sikander Berry doesn't get much scope. On the whole, AURANGZEB has a great premise, but great plots don't, generally, translate into great films. This one's way too lengthy and mediocre [second hour] to leave any kind of an impression whatsoever. Disappointing!</Review>

Another goon is held down as his skull is pushed through an ice-crusher. A third, tied to a chair, is run over by a speeding car in reverse. The brutality is relentless in Sanjay Gupta's 'Shootout at Wadala', a saga about the rise and fall of dreaded Mumbai gangster Manya Surve (John Abraham) in the 1970s, and his subsequent death in 1982 in what was reportedly the first police encounter. Based on a chapter in S Hussain Zaidi's book 'From Dongri To Dubai', the film nevertheless conveniently insists that it be viewed "as a hybrid between fact and fiction". This means that while the story is rooted in Manya Surve's journey from an innocent, bright college student to one of the city's most powerful mafia dons, 'Shootout at Wadala' is a potpourri of stomach-churning slashing and shooting, writhing item girls, and lewd dialogue. In fact, Gupta infuses so much violence and sex into this tale that it hits the G-Spot - and by this, I mean, gratuitous. The director has no qualms pandering to the lowest common denominator; inserting item songs at will, peppering his actors' lines with cusswords, filming bump-and-grind lovemaking sequences, and even throwing in a titillatingly-shot rape scene. The film ostensibly follows Manya in a story as old as time itself - a boy is framed by the cops, he befriends a thug (Tusshar Kapoor) in prison, and escapes a hardened criminal. Manya decides to stand up to the Haksar dons, brothers Zubair (Manoj Bajpai) and Dilawar (Sonu Sood), and form his own gang. Meanwhile, the cops, led by the dedicated Aafaque Bagraan (Anil Kapoor) and his team (Ronit Roy and Mahesh Manjrekar), try to contain the gang wars by pitting one against the other. Manya's biggest weakness is predictably his girl, college sweetheart Vidya (Kangna Ranaut), who is repelled by his line of work but can't give him up for good. While the songs are nothing to write home about, 'Shootout at Wadala' has some trademark Gupta flourishes in the sepia-soaked camerawork, slow-mo action sequences and slick editing. The problem, unfortunately, is that there is barely any semblance of storytelling here. Scenes of visceral violence between the gangs are strung together, interrupted only by Milap Zaveri's clap-trap lines. It all feels empty beyond a point because none of the characters are developed enough for you to care about them. John Abraham pours everything he's got into the author-backed role, using his eyes and his voice as much as his vein-popping physicality, in his effort to humanise Manya. Kangna, sobbing and nagging most of the time, reduces her character to a mawkish caricature. Anil Kapoor plays it straight as the cop on a mission, while Manoj Bajpayee and Sonu Sood get a few moments to make an impression. 'Shootout at Wadala' revels in its violence, yet sadly all the bloodshed leaves you unaffected and cold. I'm going with two out of five.</Review>

Because I'm a sucker for gritty gangsters and sharp cops. Because I like the bang-bang stuff, when done well. And because there's nothing as cool as retro, in the right hands. Shootout At Wadala gives us a bunch of gangsters and cops, all trying very hard for coolth. It has action, some of it explosive, but not madly new. What stops it from becoming the film that it could have is an avalanche of dialogue, the sort of smart-alecky lines that sounded so right in the 70s. In 2013, they seem like a tired device to hang an entire film on. And the fact that this genre is now feeling the weight of having been trod upon too often. Shootout At Wadala, based on S Hussan Zaidi's account of the rise of the mob in the Mumbai of the 70s, is a sequel to Shootout At Lokhandwala. This time around, it has Sanjay Gupta at the helm, and the director knows how to mount the big action scenes, and how to create maximum mayhem. Some of the sequences leap off the screen, and the action is solid. So are many of the performances. Bajpayee seems to be making the most of his second coming: he is clearly enjoying himself, as is Manjrekar, who plays a laconic cop. It's also good to have Anil Kapoor back amongst us. Jackie Shroff shows up for a tiny cameo, and suddenly, seeing him and Anil Kapoor in one film, you are reminded of Parinda, the film which got gangsters back into vogue again. But that is all the similarity there is. The weak link in the film is the lead. John Abraham flaunts the most impressive musculature amongst the current crop of Bollywood heroes (he has his own shirtless moment with each gleaming well defined pack visible from a distance), but not the acting chops. Item girls, including Priyanka Chopra as the very Badmaash Babli and Sunny Leone as the impossibly curvy Laila, come and go. And the dialogue, smutty and excessive, is poured heavily upon everything. Not as much bang for my buck as I would have liked.</Review>

He escapes from jail and instantly builds a fiefdom of rotten, sexist thugs�an addition to the gangs during their heyday in Mumbai. Zubair (Manoj Bajpai) and Dilawar (Sonu Sood) head the rival gang. Some things do not change. Director Sanjay Gupta�s every action sequence is shot in slow motion. Every entry of a new character is in slow motion. Bits of the three item numbers in the film�yes, three�are in slow motion. A loose, directionless script and insipid dialogues (Manya and his men are often engaged in long conversations about the female anatomy) take their toll half an hour into the film. Abraham tries very hard to play a brooding, ruthless gangster but the character does not engage. The bad writing, of course, does not help. Bajpai is predictably good in his dialogue-baazi; so is Sood. As far as borrowed scenes go, Shootout at Wadala has the most unimaginative copy of a scene previously borrowed or alluded to by film-makers: the assassination of Sonny Corleone at the toll plaza. Shootout at Wadala released in theatres on Friday.</Review>

Toss the item bombs into the mix and you have the good old seeti bajaao stuff going. Shootout At Wadala (SAW) marking the return of director Sanjay Gupta does not reveal much ambition beyond pleasuring the larger audience with a loud spectacle of sex and violence, but it works. The film borrows from S. Hussain Zaidi's book Dongri To Dubai to account the Mumbai police force's first recorded encounter killing - of gangster Manya Surve at the Wadala junction on November 1, 1982. In that sense, the events in this film precede the timeline of Shootout At Lokhandwala (SOL), Gupta's 2007 production narrating the Maya Dolas encounter of 1991. SAW is definitely more gripping than SOL. Gupta has picked a sliver of an account from Zaidi's book and mixed it with liberal doses of fiction to get the drama going in SAW. Adapting original tales to suit desi tastes has always been the director's forte. In the past, he has lifted ideas from sources as diverse as Hollywood, Korean and Japanese films. This time, he officially draws inspiration from Zaidi's book. You won't miss the Tarantino-esque edge in treatment, too. SAW is entertaining fare if you are willing to overlook authenticity, and the fact that the pace is sluggish in portions of the second half. Overall, it is a gangsta trip throbbing with adrenaline rush and Gupta does well to underplay the melodrama so as not to dilute the impact. Lovers of hardcore action should lap it up. The violence in the film is strong but it never gets extreme. John Abraham was designer perfect as Manya, hunk of an antihero who is emotionally vulnerable but shrewd as a goon. John gives his best to this film, making most of the action hero avatar at hand. The film benefits from a stellar supporting cast. Anil Kapoor's top cop is a delight to watch, scoring with sheer screen presence. Manoj Bajpai's role bearing shades of Dawood Ibrahim's brother is a prime attraction. Sonu Sood continues evolving with each new role. SAW is a toast to machismo and heroine Kangna Ranaut does not get much scope as Manya's lover, beyond the steamy lovemaking grind. Any resemblance her look may bear to Rekha's in Ijaazat is purely coincidental, we guess.</Review>
      <Review Id="242" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/shootout-at-wadala-movie-review-807" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="2nd May, 2013" Likes="2100" Rating="2.5/5">Another thriller about cops and goons set in the Mumbai underworld? Yes, pretty much so. But Shootout at Wadala is more than just a series of action scenes strung together with the purpose of revealing the many dangers that lurk in mafia land. As far as the plot goes, the film does not proffer much that has not been seen before. But director Sanjay Gupta brings a degree of flair and finesse to the table and gives the hackneyed and violent story a sustained edge that is difficult to ignore. Shootout at Wadala is a hyper-dramatized and stylized cinematic version of what is essentially a journalistic account (taken from S Hussain Zaidi�s book Dongri to Dubai) of the rise and fall of a Mumbai mafia don in the 1970s and 1980s. With many dates, ranging from the 1970s all the way to January 1982, thrown into the narrative to create the film�s historical context, Shootout at Wadala freely fictionalizes details drawn from the police files. The film scores on two fronts � the niftily choreographed action sequences and the sharply written dialogues (Milan Milap Zaveri). But in both respects, a tendency to err on the side of excess mars the overall impact. The action, although filmed in a manner that is raw and authentic, tends to get a touch monotonous after the first few set pieces have done their bit. The dialogues are hard-hitting in parts, but occasionally go overboard with the cuss words. Expletives have really lost their ability to shock � in Shootout at Wadala they raise a few laughs. The laboured comedy is out of place in a two-and-a-half-hour film replete with high-voltage action sequences interspersed with dramatic confrontation scenes that keep it on the boil all the way through. The well-calibrated and explosive climax provides a fitting finale to the blood-soaked crime drama and makes up for some of the more slipshod portions. Shootout at Wadala is enlivened by a clutch of solid performances. At one end are the men in uniform (Anil Kapoor, Mahesh Manjrekar, Ronit Roy), at the other the gangsters (John Abraham, Manoj Bajpayee, Sonu Sood, Tusshar Kapoor). A sense of d�j� vu is inevitable. Yet Shootout at Wadala delivers many an ace in terms of style. Premises of a jail, congested bylanes, seedy gangland hideouts, and sordid brothels and police vans are Sanjay Gupta�s favourite sites and they serve to enhance the noir feel of the film. This is Gupta�s first film in eight years � his last directorial outing was the derivative dark thriller Zinda � and his storytelling methods are still as dry as gunpowder. Shootout at Wadala has the makings of a blockbuster, but unlike many Mumbai films that are part of the 100-crore club, it has a logical core that, despite relying on many of the conventions of commercial Hindi cinema, does not degenerate into outright pulp. If there is a major weakness in the film, it must be the fact that John Abraham plays the central character and is called upon to carry the venture on his shoulders. He is in virtually every frame of Shootout at Wadala. He plays Manya Surve, a college student who, after a murder rap and an escape from prison, rose to challenge the dominant underworld gang of the era and was eventually killed in a police encounter, the first-ever recorded in the city�s crime history. Abraham goes all out as a tough-as-nails criminal (warding off rivals and cops alike) and a genteel lover (wooing, losing and reclaiming Kangana Ranaut), but the pressures of the histrionic range that he must traverse leave him groping for the right emotive chords at times. Mercifully, the cast of Shootout at Wadala has a couple of seasoned actors who never seem to falter � Anil Kapoor (ACP Afaaque Bhagran, Manya�s principal tormentor) and Manoj Bajpayee (Zubair Imtiaz Haskar, a character modelled on Dawood Ibrahim). Add to that the presence of Sonu Sood (Zubair�s younger brother, Dilawar), who, too, is in fine fettle, and you have a drama that has the acting firepower to blast its way through trouble. Thrills of the cheaper variety are provided by not one, not two, but three item girls � Priyanka Chopra (Babli badmaash), Sunny Leone (Laila) and Sophie Chaudhry (Aala re aala). These raunchy numbers are fillers unabashedly designed to provide eye candy relief from all the virility on show and, therefore, add no real intrinsic value to the film. But they do not get on the nerves quite in the manner that item numbers tend to do. Shootout at Wadala captures the grit and grime of the mean streets to perfection thanks to the classy camerawork of DOP Sameer Arya and additional DOP Sanjay F. Gupta. The film is generally entertaining without attaining the sort of innate quality that could attract favourable comparisons with Ram Gopal Varma�s Satya and Company or Vidhu Vinod Chopra�s Parinda. But that could hardly be a reason to write off the film.</Review>

But the maker takes the cinematic liberty of changing the material at hand to make his film and characters more engaging. Or should we say largely entertaining. 15 minutes into the film you know Gupta means business as knives gash, guns explode, blood flows, actors mouth expletives galore and items girl gyrate shamelessly. SAW has two protagonists�Manya Surve( John Abraham) a bright college student from the 70s, who finds himself inexorably drawn into a vortex of crime. The other leading man is Aafaque Bagraan(Anil Kapoor) a trigger-happy cop who wants to clean up the streets of the maximum city. As the police and the criminals play the regular usual cat and mouse game; the screenplay introduces the viewer to endless gangsters and their girls. There's Vidya( Kangana Ranaut), Manya's love-interest, Sheikh Munir(Tusshar Kapoor), Gyanchod (Siddhanth Kapoor) and a couple of more hoodlums who are his henchmen. And you have their deadly opponents�the Haksar brothers, Zubair ( Manoj Bajpayee) and Dilawar(Sonu Sood). Manya and Zubair wrest to take over the Mumbai mafia. Quite naturally the opposing gangs bay for one another's blood. And in true Bollywood style, the slaying is interrupted only with the swaying; so you have three item songs lined up. The first item has adult star, Sunny Leone, whose song�Laila teri Le Legi is alone worth the price of a ticket. This Canadian-Indian girl is such an object of desire; she makes other dance girls pale in comparison. The other selling point of the film is Milap Zaveri's dialogue. Many of the lines are claptraps. But be warned, there's a liberal peppering of filthy lingo that will make you cringe. The performances are largely A-grade. Manoj tops the list. And though he's a Mafioso, his demeanour will get the maidens to melt. Sonu who plays Dilawar, succeeds in spreading menace and speaks eloquently with his eyes. John is the one with the maximum screen time. From vulnerable to invincible, from a testosterone wonder to a believable actor, Manya is his career's best act. Tusshar is earnest and effective. Kangana may not have the item song benefit but she has recall value as the anguished gangster's moll. Siddhant Kapoor, son of baddie Shakti Kapoor is also a young talent to watch out for. Anil Kapoor does his encounter specialist act with elan. He's supported ably by Ronit Roy, Mahesh Manjrekar and Jackie Shroff who puts in a guest appearance as the police chief. SAW ultimately belongs to Gupta, who stays true to the genre and makes a welcome return to the credible lot of Bollywood directors.</Review>

Pick up a real mafia from the past, throw in as many real life characters around it as possible, convolute the narrative with non-linear approach with each back and forth bring out a new character, stuff at least two-three item songs and voila! You have a gangster movie. What's a real pity is watching Sanjay Gupta, who has excelled in gangster films in the past, himself taking the easy route with his latest Shootout At Wadala. The film takes off with Asfaque Bagraan (Anil Kapoor) dumping a bruised, shot and beaten Manya Surve (John Abraham) in a police van. Asfaque wants to know the truth, the reason for the rise of Manya, the reason for his callous deeds and then starts the flashback as Manya reveals his story slowly. A college boy Mahohar Arjun Surve is awaiting the results of his finals. He wrongly gets embroiled in a murder that his elder brother had committed and gets shoved into the jail under life imprisonment. Life in jail gets worse as his brother gets slashed right in front of his eyes. However, he makes friends in there like Sheikh Munir (Tusshar Kapoor) and Veera toughen him up, help him escape from the jail and later join his gang. His sudden rise starts challenging the two don brothers Dilawar Imtiyaz Haksar (Sonu Sood) and Zubair Imtiyaz Haksar (Manoj Bajpayee) and what follows is a gruesome gangwar. All in front of the eyes of the helpless cops played by Anil Kapoor, Ronit Roy and Mahesh Manjrekar until they are given the orders to encounter Manya on sight! Sanjay Gupta who's first part of the Shootout franchise, Shootout At Lokhandwala, was a sweeper hit, turns his second into such a depressing display of cliched elements from Bollywood. The film is replete with puerile acting, convenient narrative, pointless dialoguebaazi and predictable story. It's not always easy to adapt from a book and based on Dongri To Dubai, the film suffers from the same problem. The characters and episodes which would've otherwise grown on a reader get dealt with very haphazardly and hence don't leave any impact on the audience. To add to the agonizingly long film of a run time of 150 minutes, there are multiple song sequences, three item numbers at that, which literally leave you red on your face. Actors Anil Kapoor, Ronit Roy, Mahesh Manjrekar, Manoj Bajpayee and Sonu Sood put together brilliant performance especially Anil Kapoor who even at his age easily performs some of the most difficult chase and stunt sequences. John Abraham portrays his grittiest character till now but fails to hold together the narrative. Tusshar surprisingly plays his part well and can easily be considered better than John. Jr. Shakti Kapoor, Siddhant is impressive in his debut. Kangna Ranaut plays a typical part which she may have in the past too. To sum it up, Shootout At Wadala lacks innovation and courtesy the long run time and jarring songs ends up disappointing the audience.</Review>

Films like DEEWAAR [Yash Chopra], PARINDA [Vidhu Vinod Chopra], AGNEEPATH [Mukul S. Anand], DAYAVAN [Feroz Khan], SATYA [Ramgopal Varma], COMPANY [Ramgopal Varma], VAASTAV [Mahesh Manjrekar], GANGSTER [Anurag Basu], SHOOTOUT AT LOKHANDWALA [Apoorva Lakhia] and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI [Milan Luthria] have left an indelible impression on the minds of cineastes. Now Sanjay Gupta enters the dark alleys of 1970s and 1980s with SHOOTOUT AT WADALA, which is partly based on a book ['Dongri To Dubai', penned by Hussain Zaidi]. It chronicles the lives of gangsters, gang wars and also talks of the first encounter killing of a gangster. Not surprisingly, while Gupta retains the essence, he ensures he adapts the book delightfully, adding layers and fictionalized episodes, so that the outcome isn't dry, dark or depressing. Nor does it come across as a documentary. SHOOTOUT AT WADALA primarily focuses on that one man [Manya Surve] who took on the powerful gangsters in his prime. Much has been written about the dominance of several gangsters. But not much is known about Manya Surve. SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is his story. His rise to power. His dominance. His death. Although Gupta has attempted volatile subjects in the past, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is his most accomplished work as a raconteur. He finds his voice with this film. He returns with a vengeance after a sabbatical of almost eight years [after ZINDA in 2005, although he directed a couple of short stories in DUS KAHANIYAAN in 2007, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is his next full-length feature]. The saying, 'Form is temporary, class is permanent' holds true for Gupta, as he makes a scathing statement with his newest venture, taking rapid strides as a storyteller, coming up with a fare that balances form and content admirably. SHOOTOUT AT WADALA narrates the story of Manya [John Abraham], who gets implicated in a murder case and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Manya flees the prison, returns to Mumbai and forms his gang. The cops launch Operation Manya Surve to curb his dominance� Besides encapsulating the rise and fall of Manya Surve, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA talks about the lesser-known aspect of his life: His love interest. And it is this attribute in Manya's personality that sets it apart from other gangster movies. It brings to the fore the humane aspect of a gangster who sent a chill down the spine in his prime. While Gupta is synonymous with depicting machismo with flourish, tender moments such as these have been neglected in his movies, post HAMESHAA [Saif, Kajol]. But the sensitivity and ease with which Gupta balances the explosive and hot-tempered attitude of the gangster [with his rivals] and the soft and affectionate persona [with his lady love] gives the film that extra edge. The second half of the film and more specifically, the final moments leave you awe-struck. The screenwriting [Sanjay Gupta, Abhijeet Deshpande, Sanjay Bhatia] is watertight. Although it takes time to settle down, the solid writing in the second hour keeps you on the edge. In fact, the turn of events in the second half takes the film to its zenith. A large chunk of SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is devoted to high-voltage action sequences. Unlike some recent films, the action here is raw and real, reminiscent of the films of the 1980s. The action -- brutal, unrepressed and energetic -- is clearly a notch above the recent films that depict the hero bashing up rogues like we swat flies and mosquitoes. Unquestionably, it's one of the highpoints of the movie [Tinu Verma]. Another aspect that stays with you is the dialogue [Milap Milan Zaveri]. The lines leave a remarkable impact without crossing the familial domain. Every dialogue is delivered as a punch and there are times when you cheer and applaud the effort. It won't be erroneous to state that the dialogue is one of the pillars of this enterprise. Although Gupta and Milap have worked several times in the past, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is Milap's best work so far, after KAANTE. Since the gangster flick is set in the 1970s and 1980s, the soundtrack [Anu Malik, Anand Raaj Anand, Meet Brothers Anjaan, Mustafa Zahid] is reminiscent of the music of that era. However, it's the items songs that catch your attention. 'Babli' [filmed on Priyanka Chopra], 'Laila' [filmed on Sunny Leone] and 'Aala Re Aala' [filmed on Sophie Choudry] are foot-tapping and the presence of curvaceous women only acts as an eye candy. Editing [Bunty Nagi] is skillful. Despite a run time of more than 2.30 hours, you never lose the narrative for a second. Background score [Amar Mohile] blends with the on-screen happenings wonderfully. Cinematography [Sameer Arya; additional DoP: Sanjay F. Gupta] is top notch, with the bygone era being depicted with flourish. Gupta is known for extracting inspiring performances! Leading the pack is, without doubt, John Abraham, who makes the character of Manya Surve come alive on screen. It's a drastic transition for John as he has several heavy-duty scenes to perform and the actor does the switch from an action hero to an able performer with much delight. Call this a coincidence, whenever John has been cast in a negative role, his performance has always stood out [ZINDA, DHOOM and RACE 2]. Now SHOOTOUT AT WADALA will prove to be the talking point. Anil Kapoor reinvents himself yet again. So good is the veteran that you never get enough of him. Watch him lock horns with varied actors in the film and you realize, he's one of those rare actors who cannot be overpowered. Ever. Manoj Bajpayee glides into his character effortlessly and delivers a magnificent performance. Tusshar Kapoor springs a big surprise, making you believe in the character he's portraying on screen. He adds tremendous credence to his character. Sonu Sood is electrifying. In the post-interval portions specifically, Sonu gets some meaty scenes to sink his teeth into and he grabs the opportunity instantly. Ronit Roy is another actor to watch out for. He makes his presence felt in a noteworthy role. Mahesh Manjrekar doesn't get much scope, while Akbar Khan, Ranjeet and Jackie Shroff appear in cameos. Kangna delivers a wonderful performance [especially towards the final moments] and stands her own despite the presence of actors with challenging characters. Sanjeev Chadha is effectual in his film debut. Siddhanth Kapoor is confident in his first outing as an actor. Karan Patel makes his presence felt. Arif Zakaria is alright. Raju Mavani is perfect and so is Raju Kher. On the whole, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is a fire-brand, paisa vasool entertainer. Brutal and electrifying, it is one of those theatre-going experiences that has a plot, is packaged well and has content [drama, action, dialogue, songs, performances] that works big time with the avid moviegoer. Sanjay Gupta delivers a solid punch!</Review>

      <Review Id="246" Name="Karan Anshuman" Expected="" Link="http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Film-review-Shree/articleshow/19751885.cms" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="27th April, 2013" Likes="2" Rating="1.5">Shree attempts a genre rare for Hindi cinema: science fiction and straightaway earns a few points in trying to be original. But with a nearly zero budget production cost and general lack of polish in every department, it finds itself in unenviable territory: a good idea, a poor script, and shoddy execution. At this point let me state that the makers of the film asked reviewers not to reveal what the film is about. However, any analysis of the movie won't be possible without doing so. If you're going to watch Shree regardless, stop reading now. SPOILERS AHEAD. Shree (Husain Kuwajerwala) is struggling to ends meet with his dead end job at a mobile phone company. His fiery girlfriend wants to marry him. He has no way to support her and her mother reminds him of this reality every time she gets a chance. Yet something sinister is happening in cyberspace and suddenly he's called to a derelict farmhouse where the who's who of the city (a top cop, a top scientist, and the rich man who owns the telco he works at) make him an offer he can't refuse. Money for being a subject for an experiment. One that has already failed on multiple occasions. And what is this experiment? Time travel. This is an exciting prospect for a Hindi movie no doubt, and the plot has many twists and is about as complicated as a couple of Abbas-Mustan films combined. And yet Shree is not half as entertaining as even one. It gets caught in its own trap of over-explaining the science (and there is a distinct, unique thought here involving time-fissures created by natural disasters) and trying hard to stay a step ahead of the audience. But this exercise creates its own fissures and alienates the viewer with long, dry spells that serve to bore. The screenplay requires the same situation to play out multiple times. The first time you've no clue what's happening, the second time you already know what to expect. And the further you go with the premise, the more loopholes appear; which entirely defeats the purpose of a concept-driven film with an SF theme. Shree could've been the tight, thriller SF it wanted to be. But the opportunity is wasted. Well below average in the tech departments, Shree struggles with the basics. Sound design is an aspect they forgot to budget for. One piece of music for the action is on continuous loop. Production design is appalling. I'm not sure if there was an art director present at all. Perhaps the producers were doubling up as the art team because their jewelry brand's name appears in various points all over the film: on hoardings, shops, dialogue, everywhere. Why not shoot an ad instead? And what is that 'phat gayi' song? Kuwajerwala's debut film may have sounded very interesting in a narration and you can sympathize why he would opt for Shree, but his genuine effort is thoroughly defeated by the final product. Not helping in the cause is the woefully over-thetop and hyper Anjali Patil. Shivani Tanksale, though, fares better and seems in on the result. You can kill time with Shree, but as Benjamin Franklin said, "Lost time is never found again." By the way, he also said, "Time is money."</Review>
      <Review Id="247" Name="Gaurav Malani" Expected="" Link="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-26/news-interviews/38842814_1_shree-experiment-film" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="26th April, 2013" Likes="66" Rating="on the website">Science fiction still remains a genre less exploited in Bollywood and it's primarily for dearth of aptitude over lack of audience. In such scenario, any film that can handle the genre reasonably well is worth acknowledging. Shree might be low on production and star value but is at least high on concept level. The story is of Shree (Hussain Kuwajerwala), an average middle class man struggling to make ends meet in Mumbai and marry his girlfriend Sonu (Anjali Patil). One day a businessman offers him big money if he agrees to give 12 hours of his life and participate in an experiment. Unaware of the experiment or its outcome, Shree is lured in by the money and gives his consent. When he wakes from the experiment, he realizes that he has multiple murder charges on him and is running away from the police. The most important part for a science fiction is to make its fictional element look credible. And to a certain extent and at its level, this film does manage to pull it off. Revealing the sci-fi element here would be a major spoiler but thankfully it isn't something that is logistically demanding or calls for advanced special effects. So even within the confines of its modest budget, Shree doesn't have anything to lose or compromise. In fact the sci-fi element is just used as a pretext to initiate a suspense crime drama where the protagonist has to prove himself innocent of the criminal accusations against him. Debutante writer-director Rajesh Bachchani succeeds in blending these two genres and weaving an interesting narrative out of it. At instances, the film reminds of Hollywood science fictions like Source Code and Groundhog Day but Shree isn't a blatant remake and has a story of its own. However beyond the storytelling, the film leaves a lot to be desired on the technical front. The cinematography and music are quite tacky. Also somewhere the direction lacks finesse and slickness. Then the film employs some intentionally idiosyncratic characters like the villain sidekick who speaks in chaste Hindi for no good reason and seems unintentionally funny. Hussain Kuwajerwala makes a confident big screen debut and pulls off his part quite convincingly. Anjali Patil, however, is too loud, shrill and irritating in the most chaotic character in the film. Others lend adequate support. Shree is an experiment that seems a little 'ahead of its time'. More than anything else, it brings a hope that the genre can be explored more resourcefully in future. Till that happens... try this one. Not bad at all!</Review>
      <Review Id="248" Name="Mansha Rastogi" Expected="" Link="http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/12508/bollywood.hindi/shree/4203/review.htm" Affiliation="nowrunning.com" Date="26th April, 2013" Likes="9" Rating="2/5">There's a reason why even some of the biggest of our Bollywood filmmakers don't try their hands in the sci-fi genre. Either it gets way too expensive a task to execute or maybe Hindi films just lack that imaginative thinking. In such a scenario when a small time film revolving around the sci-fi elements makes it to the theaters it does make one inquisitive to know what it has to offer. The film in question is Shree and we tell you whether it's worth your while or not. Shree (Hussain Kuwajerwala) is an ordinary man who works as a small time accountant at a telecom company. He is in love with a girl Sonu (Anjali Patil) from his locality but cannot marry her till he fulfils her mother's demands; that of having his own flat in Mumbai along with a well paying job. Luck strikes as the owner of his company Mr. Randhawa (Rio Kapadia) zeroes in on Shree as his last guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The stakes are high, Shree is offered 20Lakhs to approve of the experiment which will last 12 hours but the details or results of the experiment are kept safeguarded, even from him. The greed for money takes over as Shree agrees to the experiment. But as soon as these 12 hours start, he finds that his simple life has been turned upside down. He gets accused of murdering the scientist the commissioner of police and many more people. What really happens in those 12 hours? Watch the film to find out. In the times of spoon-feeding the audience or making movies for dim-wits, first time director Rajesh Bachchani surprisingly, comes up with a plot that makes you use your brains in order to keep up with the twists in the plot. Although the film may remind you of many Hollywood films like Groundhog Day, Terminator, Source Code etc. Bachchani does quite an impressive job to come up with a concept along with its reasoning to make it appear believable. However, where the filmmaker's novice capabilities come to fore is the execution of it all. Instead of playing on the intrigue factor, the filmmaker makes everything in your face. Also the production quality doesn't aide the sci-fi scope and ends up looking like some project by a film institute student who had a story but not the funds. Even on the casting front the filmmaker fails to please. He ropes in actors that don't look like scientist or businessman or even a police commissioner. Worse still, the actors fail completely in putting together even a half decent show. Anchor cum TV Actor Hussain Kuwajerwala lacks acting capabilities and it can evidently be seen in the film. His act of a simple man looks forced and farcical. Anjali Patil is one of the biggest annoying factors in the film. She is loud to the point of jarring and unbearable. To sum it up, Shree had tremendous potential to make for a great sci-fi thriller but fails to leave an impact.</Review>
      <Review Id="249" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/590335" Affiliation="bollywoodhungama.com" Date="26th April, 2013" Likes="46" Rating="2">More and more telly actors are setting their sights on the big screen. Hussain Kuwajerwala, a popular name on television, takes the big leap from TV to movies with SHREE. But unlike most big screen debuts that tilt towards rom-coms, Hussain's big screen debut is a sci-fi thriller. Rajesh Bachchani, who has several television shows to his credit, opts for an unconventional premise that had the potential to be intriguing and nerve-racking, but like most Hindi films, captivating ideas on paper don't translate into absorbing movies. So where does the problem lie? Well, the storyteller ought to know that narrating a story with utmost simplicity is of paramount importance. In addition, the screenwriting fluctuates constantly between attention-grabbing and unadventurous, which is its biggest shortcoming... Shree [Hussain Kuwajerwala], an ordinary man, works at a telecom company. He's in love with a girl [Anjali Patil], but needs to be financially secure before he settles down. Randhawa [Rio Kapadia], a wealthy businessman, zeroes in on Shree as his last guinea pig. Shree is the last piece of puzzle of a scientific experiment, devised by a scientist, supported by the commissioner of police and funded by Randhawa. Randhawa offers Shree Rs 20 lakhs for participating in an experiment which will last for 12 hours. Shree trusts them and trades 12 hours of his life. But as soon as the time starts, he realizes that his life has turned upside down. He's accused of murdering the commissioner of police. Shree, an ordinary man, is now the most wanted man in the city... To give the credit where it's due, the thriller -- filmed on authentic locations -- stays a step ahead of the audience initially. It has the elements of thrill -- it gets intense and spine-chilling at varied occasions. The raconteur builds up the plot smartly, encompasses several twists during the course of the film which are wonderfully tied together, but he blows it all up before he reaches the finale. SHREE is a well-meaning film, but the impact it ought to make is lost due to its lopsided writing. Unfortunately, the film never reaches the stage where the spectator would exclaim, 'Wow! What a spine-chilling cat and mouse game!'. The drama that envelops dishonesty, treachery and viciousness doesn't hit you with sufficient force. Hussain has an imposing screen presence and he displays the myriad emotions with admirable ease. Anjali Patil, last seen in a commanding role in CHAKRAVYUH, is a fine talent, but is over the top this time. Paresh Ganatra, mostly cast in comic characters, handles the negative part well. Shivani Tanksale is supremely efficient, while Rio Kapadia doesn't get much to do. On the whole, SHREE has a fascinating premise, but the erratic writing plays the spoilsport!</Review>

The gamut of expressions he employs can be counted on a single finger, and if you�re wondering why he�s been cast as Karanvir Singh Dogra in Dilip Ghosh�s Commando-A One Man Army, look no further than the early scene where he�s performing push-ups. Between raising and lowering his body with his hands pressed to the ground, he leaps as if released by a spring and touches his toes. In mid air. Surely that�s reason enough � along with the fact that his body seems to have muscles where no muscle ought to exist, and those muscles seem to have little muscles of their own. The simple act of raising an arm produces such variations in his musculature that if he didn�t belong in testosterone-fuelled action films like this, he�d be a model in a medical-school classroom, patiently striking poses as an instructor kept pointing to this -oid and that one. How do you cast a villain against such a punishing hero? One way is to find an actor equally chiseled. Another is to write the character so colourfully that the physique is rendered redundant. And so we have Amrit Kanwal (Jaideep Ahlawat), who was born on amavas ki raat and who�s nicknamed himself after his initials and the year he was born. That�s right: he�s AK-74. And he has colourless irises and pupils, which make his eyes look like pools of white. As a finishing touch, he likes Santa-Banta jokes, which he�s prone to quoting before he offs his enemies in especially nasty ways. AK-74 becomes the villain of the story when Simrit (Pooja Chopra), the local girl he lusts after, runs away from him and takes refuge in the arms of Karanvir Singh Dogra. The couple flees into the jungles. AK-74 and his goons give chase. And we find ourselves squarely in First Blood territory, give or take a screechy heroine. Commando, like its namesake made by B Subhash in the 1980s � it featured a Jamwal-equivalent in Hemant Birje � is a B-movie that wants to be nothing more than a B-movie. And it knows its audience. The film is set in a Punjabi milieu and the emphasis is less on the script (the hero spends a year in a Chinese prison in a development that has little bearing on the rest of the story) than the action, most of which is competently staged. But that�s about all you can say. Jamwal does little that earlier action heroes did not do. The stunts may be smoother, better executed, but it�s the same dishoom-dishoom, which raises the question whether, in this age of elaborate, prop-aided stunt choreography (witness, for instance, the opening action sequence in Skyfall, set on a train), simple fisticuffs and gravity-defying kicks are enough. After the second such action sequence, I was bored. And do we need songs and dances in these films? There�s a reason First Blood doesn�t come with a Bappi Lahiri-scored interlude � Rambo ho ho�</Review>
      <Review Id="251" Name="Shubhra Gupta" Expected="" Link="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/movie-review-commando-a-one-man-army/1101515/" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="13th April, 2013" Likes="35" Rating="on the website">It's been such a long time since we saw a true blue Bollywood actioner that Commando doesn't need to be anything other than what it is: a string of explosive sequences strung through a story which exists only for the purpose of showing one man, muscles rippling, scything through a mob. Again and again and again. To that end, Vidyut Jamwal is perfect. Unlike the so-called action heroes we have right now, straining past the mid-40s line, struggling to appear credible, Jamwal looks as if he was born to do this. The opening sequence has some jaw-dropping moves (a disclaimer at the beginning tells us that he has done all the stunts, barring a few scenes in the end, himself: in one, he flips himself totally off the ground while horizontal) which instantly tells us that this man could be the real legatee of the Sty Stallone-Arnie-Diesel-Statham tradition. In other words, when he hits someone, they stay hit. Jamwal plays an Indian army commando who breaks free from beyond the China border after capture and much third degree torture. His one aim now is to 'clean up the dirt within'. In other words, the guys who make it impossible for the good guys in the armed forces function � politicians, and goons who want to become politicians. Fortunately for him, and us, Jamwal doesn't get too much speaking time. Having said what he has to, he gets down the real business of decimating the bad guys, one by one. Commando Karanveer Dogra comes to the rescue of damsel in distress Simrit (Chopra) who is on the run from the evil, cruel AK (Ahlawat). This AK is quite a piece of work. He is constantly on his phone, guffawing at Santa-Banta jokes, snarling at the cowering good folks of the Punjab village he lives in, and leering at the spirited Simrit. If Jamwal is just right for his part, Ahlawat who left a sizeable impact in Gangs Of Wasseypur and who has been biding his time in bit parts till now, carves out a lovely old-style Bollywood villain, all costume and bluster and grinning menace. That an action film should have no place for song and dance is a no-brainer. Commando has a wholly superfluous hero-heroine slo-mo jig (the long-limbed debutant Chopra and curly-mopped Jamwal staring intensely into each other's eyes while running over sand), AND a bhangra-shaadi geet, AND an item number. It also has a story that creaks . Minus these irritants, it would have been a pure adrenaline rush. Step out for the popcorn when the actors break into song; rush right back in when the fists start to fly.</Review>
      <Review Id="252" Name="Raja Sen" Expected="" Link="http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-commando/20130412.htm" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="12th April, 2013" Likes="" Rating="1.5">Imagine if John Rambo, while readying himself for First Blood's carnage in the woods, had found a woman instead of a red rag to tie around his head. And not just any woman, but one inexplicably disposed towards non-stop conversation: a Manic Punjabi Dream Girl, as it were. Imagine how pissed off Rambo'd be then.  Vidyut Jamwal, the most beefcake-y youngster to make a Bollywood debut in quite some time, takes on the one-note role with dropkicking aplomb. Playing an imprisoned commando on the run from evil Chinamen, he finds himself some trouble and, naturally, solves it by turning many an able-bodied fellow into a corpse. He's straddled with a highly moronic heroine, one who oscillates shrilly between damsel-in-distress and loudmouthed nutjob, and this excess baggage weighs Commando down quite unforgivably. It's a very bare-bones plot, clearly meant only as backdrop for Jamwal to display admittedly impressive stunt work and physical dexterity. There's more to the lad than arms like veiny tree-trunks, his skills shown best when JackieChanistically vaulting through a car window. The fight scenes, however, aren't shot engagingly enough and, given the unending dhishoomery prevalent in films of this type, look equally bland. And he never looks defeated or distressed, which is a shame. A wee bit of kryptonite never hurt a narrative, people. Thankfully, Jamwal lets his scissorkicks do the talking, which ensures we walk out of this long, exhausting film at least vaguely impressed with his competence. Nobody else in this tedious film shuts up: from an Army officer who gushes about a commando's abilities while sounding disturbingly aroused, to the nitwit girl played by Pooja Chopra: a girl with extraordinarily awkward body language and a superhuman ability to annoy. And because she can't act to save her life, this, too, must be the poor hero's job. The film starts loud and keeps getting louder. The background score pinballs between different kinds of crescendos: from operatic to spaghetti to melodramatic. And then there's a truly unique bad guy, one born (apparently to three witches) on an 'Amavas ki raat' and who has creepily white pupil-less eyes. (Yup, it's that kind of film.) That said, the excellent Jaideep Ahlawat has a blast as the villain, hamming it up with a mobile phone obsession: he plays Angry Birds a lot and reads SMS forwards to his victims before slaughtering them. Bonus points to him for a Super Mario reference at the film's climax and for, during one particularly cruel act, leavening the tension with a cricketing stance. Make no mistake, Commando is a poor film. The thrills are never quite there and, all of Janwal's eagerness and leapfrog-skills aside, it must be remembered that a Bowie knife does not Rambo make. Especially when he gives it away to a stupid girl.</Review>
      <Review Id="253" Name="Gaurav Malani" Expected="" Link="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-12/news-interviews/38490300_1_vidyut-jamwal-dilip-ghosh-cast-commando" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="12th April, 2013" Likes="16" Rating="on the website">Let the title not mislead you into believing that the film has got anything to do with war, army training or patriotic fervor. Commando essentially is about a couple who is largely running around the trees albeit for different reasons. The plot is predictably old-school where a dreaded local ganglord AK (Jaideep Ahlawat) is obsessed with a girl Simrit (Pooja Chopra) and wants to marry her, much against her wishes. Simrit tries to escape his clutches and is saved from the goons by an ex-commando Karan (Vidyut Jamwal). The two run away into forests and AK vows to get back Simrit and kill Karan. Commando is the kind of film we witnessed through the 80s where the hero expectedly makes an action entry when the heroine is attacked by some hooligans. The heroine is supposed to be awed by the machismo of this stranger and evidently fall for him. The villain's only aim in life is to knock off the hero. And the hero always comes back from the dead to rescue the heroine in the climax. Despite such unabashed conventionalism, what still makes the film click is the conviction with which it comes. The makers never get pretentious about their product and rather go full throttle with their assets. So Commando relies fundamentally on the martial arts expertise of Vidyut Jamwal who does complete justice to the film's genre of full-blown action. More than the fact that Vidyut comes as the perfect casting for the character of Commando, this seems to be a case of an action film being designed knowing Vidyut's range of combating capabilities. While Bollywood action heroes have often been one man armies, Vidyut's combats are comparatively credibly choreographed and slickly shot. Giving his character a commando tag only makes it more believable. And Jamwal's physique and finesse makes the Commando look real. With the manhunt of the duo in forests making up for the major runtime, the film almost goes into the Man v/s Wild mode and Vidyut Jamwal near about qualifies as the desi counterpart of Bear Grylls. The soldier's survival instincts often remind of Rambo's First Blood. To complement such an undaunted hero, the villain has to be as much vicious with some traditional erratic traits. So, AK often removes his sunglasses to show off his pupil-less all-white eyes, as if he were a zombie from some Ramsay horror flick. He is an angry bird fan and often shares Santa-Banta jokes with his gang before breaking into a random guffaw himself. Nevertheless this caricaturization of the villain does work in such scheme of things. While some incompatible songs are inserted in the narrative, the romance track doesn't seem forced or stretched with action being the prime focus. However the plot is largely one-dimensional without any twists or turns in store. Some well-worded dialogues try to overcome the conservativeness of the storyline. With an on-the-run setting, the film skillfully explores some wild and virgin locations of North India. The background score and sound effects add to the impact. Beyond the action, Vidyut Jamwal doesn't have to try too hard to play a no-nonsense yet cool-headed guy. Director Dilip Ghosh ensures that his protagonist speaks more through his muscles over expressions. The pretty looking Pooja Chopra does fine in her part. Jaideep Ahlawat gets a meaty role as the negative lead and relishes his role. Commando brings A-grade poise and polish to a B-grade plot. If you believe in the idea of one man army, this one won't disappoint you.</Review>
      <Review Id="254" Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Expected="" Link="http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/movie-review-commando-802" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="11th April, 2013" Likes="2100" Rating="2/5">A strapping, beefy soldier on a mission takes on a particularly repugnant small-town rogue to keep a pretty damsel out of harm�s way in this predictably visceral action flick that plays out more like a violent cut-and-thrust computer game than a movie about real, believable people. While the stunt scenes are impressively staged and filmed, the good versus evil confrontation is as old as the stunning peaks and vales around which the action unfolds. The adrenaline-pumping Commando � A One Man Army arouses about as much emotion as an early morning jog on a treadmill. Produced by Vipul Shah and directed by Dilip Ghosh, the film un-spools at a fair clip (if you discount a ridiculously out-of-place love ditty in the first half and a gratuitous item number in the second), but it makes no impression either on the mind or the heart. The film alludes to the �ten thousand� power-crazed, greedy people who have been gnawing at the entrails of the nation, but the well-meaning spiel somehow rings hollow amid all the vacuous hullabaloo that Commando rustles up. As the male protagonist puts it through a stray line of dialogue, the law of the jungle prevails here. You either kill or get killed. So, even if you were to treat this as a game of cat and mouse, it would run out of surprises within the first 30 minutes. When the film opens, the hero, Karan Vir Dogra (Vidyut Jamwal) of the 9 Para Commandos of the Indian Army, is in a Chinese army prison. He has been captured on suspicion of being on an espionage mission. A slimy minister (neither his portfolio nor is location is specified with any clarity) orders the commando�s officer, Colonel Akhilesh Sinha (Darshan Jariwala), to erase the man�s name from the rolls in order to prevent the China from using him as a political pawn. The colonel launches into a passionate eulogy on the commando�s many physical and mental virtues and his superhuman powers of endurance to make a case for a rescue mission. The politician responds with utter nonchalance: �The nation is more important than a soldier.� The officer has no answer. After braving all manner of third degree torture for a year in a dark and dank prison cell, the unbreakable commando manages to escape, with hatred embedded in his heart for the rulers of the nation. He makes it over the border into a nondescript Punjab town that is lorded over by a brutal hoodlum named Amrit Kanwal (Jaideep Ahlawat), who calls himself AK-74 because he was born on a moonless night that year. Politicians and policemen do the baddie�s bidding. He also has his sights on the town�s hottest lass, Simrit Kaur (Pooja Chopra), and is bent upon marrying her. The girl takes to her heels and runs into the commando, who himself is on the run from a variety of foes. The rest of the film is a string of chases and bloody skirmishes in the jungle that leave a trail of corpses. The protagonist is a man of few words and expresses himself mainly through his prowess as a hand to hand combatant. One can say pretty much the same about the film itself: it allows the action to take precedence over character development. So the dramatis personae aren�t flesh and blood figures the audience can develop any empathy with. The hero is an automaton-like terminator, the villain, a man born without pupils in his eyes, is a complete caricature and the motor-mouth female protagonist is pretty and pretty dumb. There is no denying that both Jamwal and Ahlawat, each in his own way, have tremendous screen presence. Jamwal does make a good action hero because he isn�t just brawn. He also has expressive eyes that can be put to infinitely better use than they are here. Ahlawat�s venal villain, who reads SMS jokes to his human quarries and cracks up before he kills them, is more funny than menacing. The two actors would be better advised to choose better vehicles than this film to display their wares. Despite all the bravura technical effort that has clearly been put into Commando, the end result simply isn�t compelling enough to merit more than two stars.</Review>

But filmmaker Vipul Shah is all out to raise the bar with his action-romance Commando: A One Man Army. Does it actually deliver some never seen before stunts as boasted? Let's find out. Para commando Karanvir Dogra (Vidyut Jamwal) crashes into the Chinese territory and is caught. After suffering a year's detention in China for being an Indian spy, he makes an escape and lands into North India. Saved from one trouble he finds himself embroiled into another as he runs into Simrit (Pooja Chopra) who is escaping too from the clutches of a powerful local political hoodlum Amrit alias AK74 (Jaideep Ahlawat). How Karanvir saves the damsel in distress is what follows through the rest of the plot.

Click to View All Filmmaker Vipul Shah when claims to give India its biggest action film he surely means it. Move away all the superstars with action that's unrealistic, this Kalari expert in real life, Vidyut Jamwal, is here to stay; for long! Debutant director Dilip Ghosh makes immense use of Vidyut's skills in martial arts and gives Hindi cinema action like never seen before. There are death defying stunts executed with such precision and dare devilry that you get completely spell-bound by it. However, one cannot speak of the same meticulous approach when it comes to scripting. Straight out of a '80s tripe plot of a hero saving the dame in distress, Dilip Ghosh doesn't bring about any innovation in the story. The romantic track of the female lead falling head over heels for the bravura of the hero has been done to death in the past. But while Dilip lets his story suffer, he balances it with his technique. The cinematography of the film by Sejal Shah is exceptionally brilliant with the portions of the forest shot picturesquely. Same goes for the direction of action sequences and the way they are captured. As for the action, the film rests heavily on the shoulders of Jaideep Ahlawat and Vidyut Jamwal. While the seasoned theater actor Jaideep, who showcased impressive histrionics in Anurag Kashyap's Gangs Of Wasseypur, clearly excels with his pure evil act. In the fight of good vs. evil, Vidyut Jamwal too delivers a crackling performance. The actor clearly stands tall as the desi counterpart of Sylvester Stallone from Rambo. Pooja Chopra on the other hand gets bogged down by the task of performing like Kareena Kapoor from Jab We Met. Her overtly chirpy act doesn't leave any impact, although the actress does show potential for better roles. To sum it up, Commando is a film that should be seen purely for its path-breaking action. As a story the film takes a beating.</Review>
      <Review Id="256" Name="Meena Iyer" Expected="" Link="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/Commando--A-One-Man-Army/movie-review/19474087.cms" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="11th April, 2013" Likes="138" Rating="3.5/5">Dilip Ghosh's Commando has a linear narrative. Set in North India, the story can even be termed archaic. It's got a hero, a heroine and a villain. Small-town goon AK-74(Jaideep Ahlawat) is irresistibly drawn to the local, fire-brand beauty Simrit Kaur(Pooja Chopra). When she resists, the bad man threatens her. She elopes to escape his advances and naturally, she's chased by AK's band of baddies. Fate smiles on her when she accidentally bumps into Karanveer Dogra(Vidyut Jammwal); a commando; so well-trained in guerrilla warfare; he can be rightly called a one man army. The action shifts to the forests. The commando and the girl break into a run with the villains, local forest officials and killer dogs hot in pursuit. From here on, the film picks up tempo. Enter South African action director Franz Sphilhaus. The director hands over his hero Vidyut to him and the combination is pure magic. Perhaps one of India's best martial arts exponents (at least in the films); Vidyut is terrific. With the stealth and dexterity of a jungle cat, this commando goes for the kill. For the first time in eons, the action scenes are totally convincing...and you can digest the fact that one man can kill them all and come back alone. If you are an action junkie and if you have peaked on Sylvester Stallone's Rambo-series, then our desi Commando, is what you will term paisa-vasool entertainment. The adrenaline rush stays with you, long after the lights come on. Vidyut Jammwal is in top form, doing full justice to the job at hand. Action superstars Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn may have superstardom and years of experience on their side; but Vidyut has the agility and novelty to match their moves. He's orgasmic to watch. Pooja Chopra (Femina Miss India-2009) is super-confident in her film debut and a welcome addition to Bollywood's heroines. One should also put in a couple of lines of praise for Jaideep Ahlawat, who has made the transition from a small part in the art-house Gangs of Wasseypur to the big-time Bollywood baddie. He's mean, menacing and maniacal without trying too hard. Note: You may not like the film, if pure action, is not your staple at the movies.</Review>
      <Review Id="257" Name="Taran Adarsh" Expected="" Link="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/566667" Affiliation="bollywoodhungama.com" Date="11th April, 2013" Likes="1300" Rating="3.5/5">Recall actors who started as antagonists, but switched to positive characters effortlessly... Several decades ago, Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha portrayed negative roles at the onset of their respective careers. Much later, Shah Rukh Khan acted in a series of career-defining [grey] characters, before he got labeled as the romantic icon of Hindi cinema. Now Vidyut Jammwal, who made his debut with FORCE, undergoes an image makeover with COMMANDO. He's cast as the conventional Hindi film hero after acting in FORCE and a couple of South Indian films as 'villain'. He fights an army of baddies single-handedly in COMMANDO. Also romances the heroine in his second Hindi outing... COMMANDO is expected to change the action landscape of Bollywood, with Vidyut partaking in never-witnessed-before action sequences, hand-to-hand combat, mid-air splits and somersaults, extreme acrobatics et al, all done *without* body double or cables, but by the actor himself. In that respect, COMMANDO takes action in Hindi movies to another level. The skeptics may argue, we have seen it all in movies starring Tony Jaa, but COMMANDO is, perhaps, the first Hindi movie that attempts to showcase a series of death-defying, high-octane stunts performed by the lead man himself. Naturally, Vidyut is being peddled as the new action hero of Bollywood. Karanvir Dogra [Vidyut Jammwal], a commando with the Indian Army, crashes into the Chinese territory. After being detained for a year in China and labeled an Indian spy, Karan escapes from the Chinese side and crosses into Himachal Pradesh. As Karan crosses into Punjab, India, he runs into Simrit [Pooja Chopra], who is escaping from Amrit aka AK47's [Jaideep Ahlawat] goons. Amrit wants to forcibly marry Simrit. Karan bashes up the goons and in turn, invites the ire of Amrit. Together, Karan and Simrit escape into the jungles, when cornered by Amrit and his cronies. Thus begins a cat and mouse game between Amrit and Karan in the deep forests... Director Dilip Ghosh stays true to the essence of the premise and promises never-witnessed-before action in COMMANDO. Having said that, I wish to add that COMMANDO isn't a film that merely celebrates action or attempts to portray Vidyut's expertise in martial arts. Also integrated is a [subtle] love story, besides drama of course. In addition, the makers punctuate the mandatory songs to spice things up. But its biggest strength is, without an iota of doubt, the action sequences, especially the ones while on the run in the jungles. COMMANDO attempts to encompass every stunt possible to entice the Indian viewer, which Vidyut implements as dexterously and effortlessly as Tony Jaa or Johnny Tri Nguyen. Nonetheless, films that focus on chase and action should stick to the core issue, hence the romance between the lead pair [in the first half of the film], the mandatory songs [especially the one filmed in Kutch, again the first hour] and the political interference [in the second hour] appear completely forced in the scheme of things. But these shortcomings are pardonable, to a large extent, for the reason that the action sequences keep you mesmerized largely. The drama has its moments, especially when the cat and mouse game begins. The sequences in the jungle -- which forms a major chunk of the movie -- and the good versus bad altercations and confrontations are attention-grabbing. Also, the writer [Ritesh Shah] knows that the closing moments ought to give the viewer a high in a film of this genre and he serves it most convincingly. The concluding moments -- when Vidyut is attacked by a South African slayer at the behest of Jaideep, right till Jaideep's elimination -- leave you awe-struck. The soundtrack [Mannan Shaah] is perfect, but amalgamating the songs with the chase sequences didn't really work for me. However, the raunchy song filmed in the second hour seems most appropriate vis-�-vis its placement. The DoP [Sejal Shah] is the behind-the-scene star of the enterprise. He captures the opaque terrain marvelously on celluloid. The stunts/action, as highlighted earlier, are top notch. The pacing too is swift, except when the songs show up. The background score [Prasad Sashte] captures the mood of the movie fruitfully when the characters embark on the chase. COMMANDO clearly belongs to Vidyut and the liberty of watching him crushing everything and everyone in sight leaves you tongue-tied. By doing the stunts without a body double or cables, he fits into the definition of India's Next Gen action hero without a hitch. He's a fine actor too, although it's the action that takes precedence over histrionics here. Pooja Chopra couldn't have asked for a better launch pad. Sure, COMMANDO is, at heart, an action fare, but as the reels unfold, you realize her role in the film has shades that are essential for a Hindi film heroine and Pooja gives it her best shot. She's photogenic, but most significantly, comes across as a poised and self-assured actress. Jaideep Ahlawat delivers an unparalleled performance, yet again. He's one of the finest talents around and even though he plays the conventional baddie, he will be recalled in the same breath as the protagonist of the film. Darshan Jariwala is alright in a cameo. On the whole, COMMANDO is vintage good versus evil saga in a strikingly new avatar. A high-voltage action fare that's racy, pulsating and packed with some adrenaline-pumping stunts. Watch it!</Review>
